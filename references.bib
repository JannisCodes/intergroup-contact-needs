Specifically, we test the hypotheses that (a) partners who serve more goals will be evaluated as more interpersonally close, supportive, and responsive than those who serve fewer goals, and (b) partners who serve more goals will be less common in social networks than those who serve fewer goals. Three studies (N = 1,064) found consistent support for these hypotheses while examining relationships with all members of participants’ active social network and their full range of goal pursuits. In addition, we found that the association between number of goals a partner serves and relationship evaluation is stronger for people who perceived their social networks as less (vs. more) instrumental on average, and among people who perceived their relationships as less close, less supportive, and less responsive, on average. Implications for close relationships are discussed.},

We propose that beyond improving attitudes toward the out-group, positive contact affects disadvantaged-group members' perceptions of intergroup inequality in ways that can undermine their support for social change toward equality. In Study 1, participants were assigned to either high- or low-power experimental groups and then brought together to discuss either commonalities between the groups or intergroup differences. Commonality-focused contact, relative to difference-focused contact, produced heightened expectations for fair (i.e., egalitarian) out-group behavior among members of disadvantaged groups. These expectations, however, proved unrealistic when compared against the actions of members of the advantaged groups. Participants in Study 2 were Israeli Arabs (a disadvantaged minority) who reported the amount of positive contact they experienced with Jews. More positive intergroup contact was associated with increased perceptions of Jews as fair, which in turn predicted decreased support for social change.

              This response clarifies, qualifies, and develops our critique of the limits of intergroup liking as a means of challenging intergroup inequality. It does not dispute that dominant groups may espouse negative attitudes towards subordinate groups. Nor does it dispute that prejudice reduction can be an effective way of tackling resulting forms of intergroup hostility. What it does dispute is the assumption that getting dominant group members and subordinate group members to like each other more is the best way of improving intergroup relations that are characterized by relatively stable, institutionally embedded, relations of inequality. In other words, the main target of our critique is the
              model of change
              that underlies prejudice reduction interventions and the mainstream concept of “prejudice” on which they are based.},

	abstract = {Assessment in clinical psychology typically relies on global retrospective self-reports collected at research or clinic visits, which are limited by recall bias and are not well suited to address how behavior changes over time and across contexts. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of subjects’ current behaviors and experiences in real time, in subjects’ natural environments. EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that inﬂuence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects’ lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data. EMA holds unique promise to advance the science and practice of clinical psychology by shedding light on the dynamics of behavior in real-world settings.},

The present research explored the hypothesis that daily variations may be understood in terms of the degree to which three basic needs—autonomy, competence, and relatedness—are satisfied in daily activity. Hierarchical linear models were used to examine this hypothesis across 2 weeks of daily activity and well-being reports controlling for trait-level individual differences. Results strongly supported the hypothesis. The authors also examined the social activities that contribute to satisfaction of relatedness needs. The best predictors were meaningful talk and feeling understood and appreciated by interaction partners. Finally, the authors found systematic day-of-the-week variations in emotional well-being and need satisfaction. These results are discussed in terms of the importance of daily activities and the need to consider both trait and day-level determinants of well-being.},

Other predictors of daily well-being included gender, whether the day fell on a weekend, and the amount of negative affect and physical symptomatology felt the day before.

These data contain a wealth of information regarding the dynamics of processes as they unfold within individuals over time. In this article, we discuss how combining intensive longitudinal data with either time-series analysis, which consists of modeling the temporal dependencies in the data for a single individual, or dynamic multilevel modeling, which consists of using a time-series model at Level 1 to describe the within-person process while allowing for individual differences in the parameters of these processes at Level 2, has led to new insights in clinical psychology. In addition, we discuss several methodological and statistical challenges that researchers face when they are interested in studying the dynamics of psychological processes using intensive longitudinal data.},

	abstract = {The topic of centering in multilevel modeling (MLM) has received substantial attention from methodologists, as different centering choices for lower-level predictors present important ramiﬁcations for the estimation and interpretation of model parameters. However, the centering literature has focused almost exclusively on continuous predictors, with little attention paid to whether and how categorical predictors should be centered, despite their ubiquity across applied ﬁelds. Alongside this gap in the methodological literature, a review of applied articles showed that researchers center categorical predictors infrequently and inconsistently. Algebraically and statistically, continuous and categorical predictors behave the same, but researchers using them do not, and for many, interpreting the effects of categorical predictors is not intuitive. Thus, the goals of this tutorial article are twofold: to clarify why and how categorical predictors should be centered in MLM, and to explain how multilevel regression coefﬁcients resulting from centered categorical predictors should be interpreted. We ﬁrst provide algebraic support showing that uncentered coding variables result in a conﬂated blend of the within- and between-cluster effects of a multicategorical predictor, whereas appropriate centering techniques yield level-speciﬁc effects. Next, we provide algebraic derivations to illuminate precisely how the within- and between-cluster effects of a multicategorical predictor should be interpreted under dummy, contrast, and effect coding schemes. Finally, we provide a detailed demonstration of our conclusions with an empirical example. Implications for practice, including relevance of our ﬁndings to categorical control variables (i.e., covariates), interaction terms with categorical focal predictors, and multilevel latent variable models, are discussed.},

It covers everything from detailed investigations of the physiological mechanisms involved in animal drives to elaborate analyses of the unconscious motives behind abnormal or symptomatic acts in a person to factor analyses of the motives people assign to themselves to explain their behavior. Different textbooks and different courses have been organized around these different areas of investigation. In this book we will draw on all these sources of information and attempt to provide an integrated view of the field by narrowing somewhat the focus of attention. The book emphasizes how motives differ from other determinants of action and how they relate to other motivation-type variables such as emotions, incentives, values, causal explanations, and conscious and unconscious intents. It examines how motives are acquired, where they come from, and on what they are based. Biological sources of human motives are reviewed, and this review introduces the topic of natural incentives, or what is sometimes called intrinsic motivation. Some selectivity is necessary in reviewing the large field of individual differences in human motive strength. Social sources of differences in motive strength are also considered, including everything from the way parents rear their children to educational interventions designed to change peoples' motives. Such studies contribute not only practical information on how to develop motives, but also theoretical information on the nature of motives and how they differ from other characteristics.

Innate behavior and its relation to the termination of needs are basic facts, as are also such physiological events as sensory after-discharge and internal oscillatory, variable factors. The development of the theory offers an account of behavior in terms of reinforcement, generalization, motivation, inhibition, oscillation, and response evocation which may be thought of as a chain of conditions beginning with the physical stimulus and ending in the response. 13 major symbolic constructs, directly or indirectly anchored to 6 objectively observable events, are utilized in explanation of the above chain of conditions of behavior. An examination of stimulus compounds and patterns leads the author, in opposition to Gestalt psychology, to the view that patterning is a secondary rather than a primary principle of behavior.

We start by discussing the results of a bibliographic search of intergroup contact research between 1937 and 2021 and organizing our analysis around two distinct phases of this research, as they are demarcated in volume and quality by Pettigrew and Tropp's landmark meta-analysis in 2006. We then turn our attention to an overview of the 12 review and commentary articles contributing to the special issue, which reflect advancements in themes, methodologies, and analytics of the last 15 years of research. We argue that this second generation of research has effectively addressed influential and legitimate critiques of the literature and, as a result, led to a more complex and nuanced understanding of intergroup contact that can now be readily harnessed by social cohesion practitioners and policy makers to increase the efficacy of contact-based interventions in society. We conclude by calling on a third generation of research on intergroup contact that fully harnesses diversity of ideas, peoples, and minds and keeps in close check unproductive dynamics that stifle scientific progress, and pose a threat to healthy and safe research communities. Together with the 50 diverse contributors of this special issue, we commit to making the intergroup contact research community, like the topic of intergroup contact itself, diverse and inclusive.},

Despite its relatively recent inception, there have now been over 70 studies showing that imagining a positive interaction with an outgroup member can reduce prejudice and encourage positive intergroup behavior. With this meta-analysis, we provide the first quantitative review of imagined contact effects on four key measures of intergroup bias: attitudes, emotions, intentions, and behavior. We also test for moderators arising from both group and study design characteristics. The analysis found that imagined contact resulted in significantly reduced intergroup bias across all four dependent variables (overall d+ = 0.35). The effect was significant for both published and unpublished studies, and emerged across a broad range of target outgroups and contexts. The effect was equally strong for explicit and implicit attitude measures, but was stronger on behavioral intentions than on attitudes, supporting the direct link between imagery and action proposedly underlying mental simulation effects. Most design characteristics had no significant impact, including valence of the imagined interaction, type of control condition, and time spent imagining contact. However, the more participants were instructed to elaborate on the context within which the imagined interaction took place, the stronger the effect. The imagined contact effect was also stronger for children than for adults, supporting the proposition that imagined contact is a potentially key component of educational strategies aiming to promote positive social change. © The Author(s).},

To accomplish this, we introduce and validate a blatant measure of dehuman-ization based on the popular depiction of evolutionary progress in the "Ascent of Man." We compare blatant dehumanization to established conceptualizations of subtle and implicit dehumanization, including infrahumanization, perceptions of human nature and human uniqueness, and implicit associations between ingroup-outgroup and human-animal concepts. Across 7 studies conducted in 3 countries, we demonstrate that blatant dehumanization is (a) more strongly associated with individual differences in support for hierarchy than subtle or implicit dehumanization, (b) uniquely predictive of numerous consequential attitudes and behaviors toward multiple outgroup targets, (c) predictive above prejudice, and (d) reliable over time. Finally, we show that blatant-but not subtle-dehumanization spikes immediately after incidents of real intergroup violence and strongly predicts support for aggressive actions like torture and retaliatory violence (after the Boston Marathon bombings and Woolwich attacks in England). This research extends theory on the role of dehumanization in intergroup relations and intergroup conflict and provides an intuitive, validated empirical tool to reliably measure blatant dehumanization.},

As part of our developing understanding of when and why certain types of contact improve intergroup relations, this paper examines some theoretical concepts useful for organizing modes of contact, building on previous schemes in the literature. It explores the idea that experiences in one type of contact generalize to other modes of contact. It then considers the degree to which individuals have choice about which mode of contact to use, and indeed whether they have choice about having contact at all, as well as whether such choices are associated with the valence of the contact. These ideas are developed into a model of flexibility in if and how to engage in contact, including the positive and negative consequences thereof. The model contributes to the literature's ability to consider both whether contact occurs and how it happens in a single framework. The paper considers whether societal inequality is reflected in the kinds of contact choices available to those with privilege and those without.},

The study assessed how post-test measures of quality of intergroup contact, outgroup evaluations, and levels of identification changed compared to their respective pre-test levels, for both National Service and control group participants. The intervention did not lead to a worsening of any of the constructs related to intergroup relations, which is noteworthy given the novelty for many participants of mixing in a multi-ethnic setting. Furthermore, all rater groups (Malays, Chinese, and Indians) maintained their ethnic identity, even in the presence of high levels of national identity, which we discuss with respect to past research on the effects of positive intergroup contact on minority group identification. However, the changes associated with the intervention yielded only small effect sizes, and, on the whole, National Service participants did not show significantly greater improvement than that experienced by control participants. We discuss the value of intergroup contact in this novel setting, considering various features of this programme that may have limited its effectiveness and discuss how such interventions can more successfully meet their goals. © 2012 The British Psychological Society.},

To counter these threats, victims must restore their sense of power, whereas perpetrators must restore their public moral image. A social exchange interaction in which these threats are removed should enhance the parties' willingness to reconcile.

Since each goal requires different research methods in terms of design, operationalization, model building and evaluation, it should form an important basis for decisions on how to set up and execute a study. To determine the extent to which developmental research is motivated by each goal and how this aligns with the research designs that are used, we evaluated 100 publications from the Consortium on Individual Development (CID). This analysis shows that the match between research goal and research design is not always optimal. We discuss alternative techniques, which are not yet part of the developmental scientist's standard toolbox, but that may help bridge some of the lurking gaps that developmental scientists encounter between their research design and their research goal.

We give particular attention to efforts to evaluate these strategies experimentally or via simulations. Although the field seems to have embraced these new tools, most of the evaluation studies suggest they produce marginal reductions in cost and non-response bias. It is clearly difficult to lower survey costs without reducing some aspect of survey quality. Other issues limiting the effectiveness of these designs include weakly predictive auxiliary variables, ineffective interventions and slippage in the implementation of interventions in the field. These problems are not, however, unique to responsive or adaptive design. We give recommendations for improving such designs and for improving the management of data collection efforts in the current difficult environment for surveys.},

The interventions' effectiveness was tested shortly after their end (k=123 comparisons, N=11371 participants) and with a delay of at least 1month (k=25, N=1650). Our data show that contact interventions improve ethnic attitudes. Importantly, changes persist over time. Furthermore, not only direct but also indirect contact interventions are successful. In addition, contact programs are effective even in the context of a serious societal conflict (e.g.,in the Middle East). Although changes are typically larger for ethnic majorities, there is an impact on minorities, too. Finally, contact interventions not only improve attitudes toward individuals involved in the program, their effects also generalize to outgroups as a whole.

Such intercultural contact results in both cultural and psychological changes. At the cultural level, collective activities and social institutions become altered, and at the psychological level, there are changes in an individual's daily behavioral repertoire and sometimes in experienced stress. The two most common research findings at the individual level are that there are large variations in how people acculturate and in how well they adapt to this process. Variations in ways of acculturating have become known by the terms integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization. Two variations in adaptation have been identified, involving psychological well-being and sociocultural competence. One important finding is that there are relationships between how individuals acculturate and how well they adapt: Often those who integrate (defined as being engaged in both their heritage culture and in the larger society) are better adapted than those who acculturate by orienting themselves to one or the other culture (by way of assimilation or separation) or to neither culture (marginalization).

Participants from five European countries (Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland and Slovakia; N=1276) freely described their contact experiences with people of neighboring nationalities and then reported on their outgroup attitudes. Contact descriptions were coded for positive versus negative valence and for person versus situation framing. Consistently across the five participant groups, positive intergroup contact was reported to occur three times more frequently than negative intergroup contact; however, positive contact was found to be only weakly related to outgroup attitudes. On the contrary, the less frequent negative (vs. positive) contact was comparatively more influential in shaping outgroup attitudes, especially when negativity was reported around the contact person, rather than the contact situation. This research's findings reconcile contrasting lines of past research on intergroup contact and suggest that the greater prevalence of positive contact may compensate for the greater prominence of negative contact, thus leading to modest net improvements in outgroup attitudes after intergroup contact.

	abstract = {For those concerned with the quality of global intergroup relationships, the 21st century has not begun auspiciously. As we enter only its fifth year, we have already seen unprecedented incidents of international conflict and terrorism (e.g., Afghanistan, 2002; Iraq, 2003; Spain, 2004; USA, 2001), a rising tide of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism in Europe and elsewhere (e.g., Allen \& Nielson, 2002), and increasingly hostile immigration receptions experienced by refugees (e.g., MORI, 2003). The task of ameliorating these problematic intergroup relationships will be arduous and complex, undoubtedly necessitating fundamental economic and political transformations, aided by the coordinated efforts of several social science disciplines. In this article, we consider the contribution that social psychology might make to such an endeavor, focusing particularly on the role of intergroup contact in reducing prejudice and in generating more favorable intergroup attitudes and stereotypes. We begin, appropriately enough in this the half centenary of its publication, with a brief reassessment of Allport's (1954) classic 'Contact Hypothesis' (see also Dovidio, Gaertner, \& Kawakami, 2003). Although Allport was by no means the first to advocate bringing groups together as a means of prejudice reduction (Watson, 1947; Williams, 1947), his theorizing in The Nature of Prejudice has justly acquired landmark status because of its lucid exposition, penetrating insights, and careful analysis of the social conditions likely to facilitate the beneficial effects of contact on intergroup attitudes and behavior. As we shall show, there is now ample evidence to support his basic contentions. However, the past 50 years have also seen important theoretical and empirical developments of the Contact Hypothesis-in particular, Brewer and Miller's (1984) decategorization model, Gaertner and Dovidio's (2000) common in-group identity model, Hewstone and Brown's (1986) intergroup contact model, and Pettigrew's (1998) theory of longitudinal contact. In this article, we aim to provide a critical assessment of these developments, focusing mainly on our own model, which provided the point of departure for our own broad research program on contact over nearly 20 years. Although our original model was conceived partly as a riposte to Brewer and Miller's (1984) principal hypothesis, and it contrasts in key respects with Gaertner and Dovidio's (2000) subsequent alternative, the evidence that has accumulated, both from our own research and that of others, now suggests to us that some rapprochement of these apparently contradictory accounts is not only possible but also highly desirable. Later in the article, we discuss how this might be achieved. We will start with a brief re-presentation of Allport's (1954) classic hypothesis and show, with reference to recent cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys, laboratory experiments, and meta-analysis, that many of his original propositions have capably withstood the test of time. We then examine Brewer and Miller's (1984) and Gaertner and Dovidio's (2000) attempts to extend the Contact Hypothesis, in both of which categorization processes play a key role. This approach sets the stage for own model, first published in 1986 (Hewstone \& Brown, 1986) and subsequently modified (Hewstone, 1996; Vivian, Hewstone, \& Brown, 1997). In that model, we were concerned with identifying the conditions that would allow the generalization of attitudes and behavior change beyond the specific context in which the contact occurs. We hypothesized that group salience-broadly speaking, the extent to which group memberships are psychologically 'present' during contact-would play a key role in encouraging such generalization, essentially suggesting that it moderates the effects of contact on prejudice reduction. We are now in a position to evaluate that hypothesis in the light of the extensive evidence that has accumulated from a wide variety of contact settings. A major portion of the article is dedicated to a review of that evidence. A further goal of our theorizing has been to understand the processes that mediate the link between contact and improved intergroup attitudes. In this review, we highlight what seems to be one of the most important of those mediating factors, intergroup anxiety. However, as we shall show, other emotions-both positive and negative-also play an important role in determining the outcomes of contact. The empirical work we present is eclectic in its variety: It includes experimental work in laboratory settings, correlational and longitudinal research in a diversity of field contexts, and studies in more applied domains such as education and acculturation. We conclude with our suggestion as to how these different models might be reconciled, for which Pettigrew's (1998) similar integration provides an instructive comparison. The article is organized into nine sections. The first briefly reviews the research inspired by the Contact Hypothesis. In Section III, we introduce the three developments of Contact Theory that occurred in the 1980s, including our own model. Sections IV-IX review the empirical research instigated by the Hewstone-Brown model. In the final Section, X, we review progress to date and attempt a theoretical integration of these models in the light of the large volume of research that they have stimulated. For convenience of exposition, we have organized the material more or less historically. Our early work in this domain was focused on the processes of stereotype change in the face of disconfirming information, such as might be encountered in a contact situation. This is the subject of Section IV. We then move to experimental studies of contact that have attempted to manipulate intergroup salience directly to test the central hypothesis of the Hewstone-Brown model (Section V), that it is only when some group salience is maintained that one will find the generalized attitude change that is the goal of contact interventions. Necessarily, such laboratory studies are limited in the range of intergroup relationships they can investigate. In Section VI, therefore, we present the results from several correlational studies conducted in a wide range of different cultural contexts. The common theme of these studies was to investigate whether group salience, as experienced and reported by participants, moderates the effects of contact on various indicators of intergroup attitude. In the course of this work, it emerged that an occasional negative by-product of too much salience could be heightened intergroup anxiety, which is usually associated with unfavorable intergroup attitudes, as Stephan and Stephan (1985) had warned some years ago. This finding led to the realization that our original model had rather neglected the affective processes implicated in intergroup contact, an oversight that we addressed in a revised version (Vivian et al., 1997). This instigated a series of studies that investigated the mediating role of anxiety and other emotions in determining the outcome of contact and that also extended the range of outcome measures employed, including measures of affect and implicit attitude. These are presented in Section VII, together with some studies that have simultaneously tested moderation and mediation. In Section VIII, we present research that has attempted to apply the Hewstone-Brown model in educational settings. In Section IX, we discuss work on acculturation of ethnic groups in pluralist societies that links directly to models of intergroup contact. Section X presents our theoretical integration. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, participants were more likely to report feeling autonomous and related when they were interacting either with family members and friends or in a dyadic situation.

Moderated multiple regression analyses suggest a multicultural integration frame moderates the relationship between SDO and feelings toward Syrian refugees in Canada when the target outgroup is portrayed as a source of intergroup threat. This moderating effect was unique to the relationship between SDO and feelings toward Syrians and did not extend to other correlates of prejudice including beliefs in zero-sum group competition or a multicultural ideology, nor did it extend to more general measures of prejudice (i.e., attitudes toward immigrants or evaluations of intercultural contact). Findings suggest the prejudice-reducing effects of a multicultural integration narrative affect group evaluations and functions by targeting beliefs in social dominance, rather than zero-sum group competition or ideological support for cultural diversity.

In Study 1, we tested the interaction between contact quantity and valence on prejudice toward Black Australians (n = 1,476), Muslim Australians (n = 173), and asylum seekers (n = 293). In all cases, the association between contact quantity and prejudice was moderated by its valence, with negative contact emerging as a stronger and more consistent predictor than positive contact. In Study 2, White Americans (n = 441) indicated how much positive and negative contact they had with Black Americans on separate measures. Although both quantity of positive and negative contact predicted racism and avoidance, negative contact was the stronger predictor. Furthermore, negative (but not positive) contact independently predicted suspicion about Barack Obama's birthplace. These results extend the contact hypothesis by issuing an important caveat: Negative contact may be more strongly associated with increased racism and discrimination than positive contact is with its reduction. © 2012 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.},

Three different measures of intergroup attitude were employed, including a new measure of infrahumanisation (Leyens et al., 2000). Support for the hypotheses was found on all three measures in the longitudinal analyses. Quantity of contact with a member of the outgroup was consistently associated with more favourable attitudes towards the outgroup as a whole. Importantly, contact was found to predict attitude but the reverse causal path was not significant. Also, on one measure there was an indication that the effects of contact quality were more beneficial when the contact persons were seen as typical of the outgroup than when they were not. It is concluded that, as originally hypothesised by Allport, contact with members of an outgroup can improve intergroup attitudes, but especially if those people can be seen as representative of their group.

Although studies of cross-group friendship have grown considerably in recent years, varied assessments leave us without a clear understanding of how different operationalizations affect relationships between friendship and attitudes. With a greatly expanded database of relevant studies, the authors compared friendship-attitude associations across a wide range of specific conceptualizations. Time spent and self-disclosure with outgroup friends yielded significantly greater associations with attitudes than other friendship measures, suggesting that attitudes are most likely to improve when cross-group friendships involve behavioral engagement.

A meta-analysis with 515 studies and more than 250,000 subjects demonstrates that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudice (mean r= -21). Allport's original conditions for optimal contact - equal status, common goals, no intergroup competition, and authority sanction - facilitate the effect but are not necessary conditions. There are other positive outcomes of intergroup contact, such as greater trust and forgiveness for past transgressions. These contact effects occur not only for ethnic groups but also for such other groups as homosexuals, the disabled and the mentally ill. Intergroup friendship is especially important. Moreover, these effects typically generalize beyond the immediate outgroup members in the situation to the whole outgroup, other situations, and even to other outgroups not involved in the contact. They also appear to be universal - across nations, genders, and age groups. The major mediators of the effect are basically affective: reduced anxiety and empathy. And even indirect contact reduces prejudice - vicarious contact through the mass media and having a friend who has an outgroup friend. Of course, negative contact occurs - especially when it is non-voluntary and threatening. Criticisms of the theory and policy implications are also discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Few studies, however, have tested whether contact-based interventions can be scaled up to improve intergroup relations at a large scale. The present research evaluated whether and when the National Citizen Service, a large-scale contact-based intervention reaching one in six 15- to 17-year-olds in England and Northern Ireland, builds social cohesion among adolescents from different ethnic backgrounds. In a diverse sample of adolescents (N = 2099; Mage = 16.37, age range: 15–17 years; 58\% female), this study used a pretest–posttest design with a double pretest to assess the intervention’s effectiveness. Controlling for test–retest effects, this study found evidence that the intervention decreased intergroup anxiety and increased outgroup perspective-taking—but not that it affected intergroup attitudes, intergroup trust, or perceptions of relative (dis-)advantage. These (small) effects were greater for adolescents who had experienced less positive contact before participating and who talked more about group differences while participating. These findings suggest that the intervention might not immediately improve intergroup relations—but that it has the potential to prepare adolescents, especially those with less positive contact experiences before the intervention, for more positive intergroup interactions in the future.},

	abstract = {Intergroup contact can be as casual as members of different groups walking past one another on the street or as intimate as developing cross-group friendships or romantic relationships. To date, however, the majority of intergroup contact research has focused on examining the effects of contact through self-report measures of interactions and friendships. While this research has made a substantial contribution to scientific understanding, less is known about how different forms of contact (casual vs. intimate) influence each other and are associated with outcomes across the lifespan. The present article focuses on intimate contact; a close and meaningful relationship or interaction with either an ingroup or outgroup member. We critically review the nature and consequences (good and bad) of intimate contact for children, youth and adults and for both majority and minority group members, focusing primarily on intimate intergroup contact. We also consider how intimate contact might be best measured in future research. Implications for research design, policy, and practice are considered.},

The aggregate relationship between extended contact and intergroup attitudes was r =.25, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = [.22,.27], which reduced to r =.17, 95\% CI = [.14,.19] after removing direct friendship’s contribution; these results suggest that extended contact’s hypothesized relationship to intergroup attitudes is small-to-medium and exists independently of direct friendship. This relationship was larger when extended contact was perceived versus actual, highlighting the importance of perception in extended contact. Current results on extended contact mostly resembled their direct friendship counterparts, suggesting similarity between these contact types. These unique insights about extended contact and its relationship with direct friendship should enrich and spur growth within this literature.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijintrel.2009.06.003},
	abstract = {This critique is divided into three sections. The first section is a review of my positions on three core issues regarding the nature of the human sciences (particularly cross-cultural and acculturation psychology) that have been raised throughout these articles. Knowledge of these positions is essential background to understanding my comments in the second section. In the second section are some comments on specific claims and assertions about my work that have been made in the articles. I believe that many of these assertions do not represent my views, nor my empirical research, on acculturation. Of necessity, I have had to select certain themes among all of these assertions. Although the special issue is a critique of acculturation theory and research in general, the majority of the comments are addressed to my work in the area. Hence, I have concentrated on criticisms directed at my own work, rather than attempting to address the field as a whole. However, my comments likely have more general import for the field of acculturation psychology as a whole. I invite readers to consider these very contrasting sets of views about how we are to understand individual human beings within the context of cultures, and of culture contact and change. A third section returns to some of the basic issues regarding the nature of the scientific enterprise. I advocate a dual approach, accepting both the natural sciences and cultural sciences ways of advancing our knowledge of human behaviour in context. I argue that dismissing the positivist traditions of the natural sciences, and replacing them with social constructionist concepts and methods is a regressive step in our search to improve our understanding of acculturation. Moreover, I have found little in these articles that advances our knowledge of acculturation, or our potential for making applications for the betterment of acculturating individuals and groups. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the joint and differential effects of positive and negative contact of migrants with natives on outgroup avoidance were addressed by examining also the mediating role of affective variables such as stereotype threat, symbolic threat and anxiety. Hypotheses were tested on two samples of African immigrants in Italy and Syrian immigrants in Turkey. Positive contact was not associated with outgroup avoidance and anxiety among African respondents who reported higher negative contact with natives. This evidence was not found among Syrian immigrants. In both samples, however, the moderating role of negative contact was found on stereotype threat. Across the two samples, anxiety was the strongest mediator of the relationship between negative contact of migrants on their avoidance of the majority group. Overall, the evidence we gathered furthers knowledge of the impact of negative intergroup contact on preventing migrant social integration.},

Two related literatures on the topic have emerged—the intergroup interaction literature and the intergroup contact literature—in which divergent conclusions have been reported. Intergroup interaction is typically found to have negative effects tied to intergroup bias, producing heightened stress, intergroup anxiety, or outgroup avoidance, whereas intergroup contact is typically found to have positive effects tied to intergroup bias, predicting lower intergroup anxiety and lower prejudice. We examine these paradoxical findings, proposing that researchers contributing to the two literatures are examining different levels of the same phenomenon and that methodological differences can account for the divide between the literatures. Further, we introduce a mathematical model by which the findings of the two literatures can be reconciled. We believe that adopting this model will streamline thinking in the field and will generate integrative new research in which investigators examine how a person’s experiences with diversity unfold.},

The authors argue that these practices have limited the contact hypothesis both as an explanation of the intergroup dynamics of desegregation and as a framework for promoting social psychological change.

First, concerns over the validity of longitudinal models are discussed before innovative analytical techniques are introduced that explore change over time. Next, intensive repeated measure designs, such as experience sampling approaches, are introduced as opportunities to investigate the day-to-day lives of individuals. Virtual reality technology is then presented as another means to examine naturalistic contact experiences in the laboratory, offering researchers an unrivaled capacity to induce uncommon contact experiences. Finally, we propose that additional sources of contextual data, such as competing media messages, could extend these models in innovative ways by accounting for the time and place surrounding intergroup contact. Similarly, longitudinal social network analysis can provide additional contextual information by considering the broader network environment in which contact occurs. We describe these innovations with the intention of spurring future research that will advance our understanding of how intergroup contact can be used to improve our societies.

	abstract = {The present article presents a meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory. With 713 independent samples from 515 studies, the meta-analysis finds that intergroup contact typically reduces intergroup prejudice. Multiple tests indicate that this finding appears not to result from either participant selection or publication biases, and the more rigorous studies yield larger mean effects. These contact effects typically generalize to the entire outgroup, and they emerge across a broad range of outgroup targets and contact settings. Similar patterns also emerge for samples with racial or ethnic targets and samples with other targets. This result suggests that contact theory, devised originally for racial and ethnic encounters, can be extended to other groups. A global indicator of Allport's optimal contact conditions demonstrates that contact under these conditions typically leads to even greater reduction in prejudice. Closer examination demonstrates that these conditions are best conceptualized as an interrelated bundle rather than as independent factors. Further, the meta-analytic findings indicate that these conditions are not essential for prejudice reduction. Hence, future work should focus on negative factors that prevent intergroup contact from diminishing prejudice as well as the development of a more comprehensive theory of intergroup contact.},

While most agree that there is no one preferred approach, it has also been argued that cluster mean centering is desirable when the within-cluster slope and the between-cluster slope are expected to deviate, and the main interest is in the within-cluster slope. However, we show in a series of simulations that if one has a multilevel autoregressive model in which the level 1 predictor is the lagged outcome variable (i.e., the outcome variable at the previous occasion), cluster mean centering will in general lead to a downward bias in the parameter estimate of the within-cluster slope (i.e., the autoregressive relationship). This is particularly relevant if the main question is whether there is on average an autoregressive effect. Nonetheless, we show that if the main interest is in estimating the effect of a level 2 predictor on the autoregressive parameter (i.e., a cross-level interaction), cluster mean centering should be preferred over other forms of centering. Hence, researchers should be clear on what is considered the main goal of their study, and base their choice of centering method on this when using a multilevel autoregressive model.},

Usability testing was conducted in a real-world environment and took place over the course of seven days, during which participants (N = 12) logged every contact they had with an outgroup member (here, older people). Subsequently, participants completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire, reporting on the usability and experience of using the Contact Logger.

The hypothesis fails to address process. The chapter proposes four processes: learning about the outgroup, changed behavior, affective ties, and ingroup reappraisal. 4. The hypothesis does not specify how the effects generalize to other situations, the outgroup or uninvolved outgroups. Acting sequentially, three strategies enhance generalization-decategorization, salient categorization, and recategorization.

Such research has typically extolled the benefits of positive interaction between members of historically divided communities, particularly on outcomes related to prejudice reduction. Emerging work in the field, however, has qualified this optimistic picture by identifying three gaps in the existing literature. First, in everyday life, contact may be construed as a negative experience that increases rather than decreases responses such as prejudice, anxiety, and avoidance. Second, in real-life settings, contact is often circumscribed by informal practices of (re)segregation that are easily overlooked if researchers rely primarily on examining structured contact and explicit processes using primarily laboratory and questionnaire methods. Third, positive contact may have “ironic” effects on the political attitudes and behaviors of the historically disadvantaged, undermining their recognition of social injustice and decreasing their willingness to engage in collective action to challenge the status quo. Although it is now a truism that intergroup contact can reduce intergroup prejudice, these developments emphasize the importance of maintaining a critical perspective on the “contact hypothesis” as a model for promoting social change in historically divided and unequal societies.

	abstract = {The needs-based model is a conceptual framework for understanding the identity-related aspects of reconciliation processes. According to the model, (a) conflicting parties experience threats to their agentic (victims) and moral (perpetrators) identities — leading to heightened needs for empowerment and acceptance, respectively, and (b) satisfying these needs increases victims’ and perpetrators’ readiness for reconciliation. In this chapter, we review studies testing the model in interpersonal and intergroup contexts. We apply the model to conflicts characterized by mutual transgressions and discuss different ways victims’ and perpetrators’ identities can be restored (e.g., via empowering and accepting messages from the other or a third party, identityaffirmation exercises). We also apply the model to contexts of structural inequality by (a) presenting evidence that intergroup contact that satisfies disadvantaged and advantaged group members’ needs for empowerment and acceptance is associated with their support for change, (b) discussing the moderating role of system justification, and (c) integrating our findings with the rank-based perspective on social class. Finally, we discuss the model’s boundary conditions and directions for future research.},

	abstract = {The past decade has seen a noticeable shift in missing data handling techniques that assume a missing at random (MAR) mechanism, where the propensity for missing data on an outcome is related to other analysis variables. Although MAR is often reasonable, there are situations where this assumption is unlikely to hold, leading to biased parameter estimates. One such example is a longitudinal study of substance use where participants with the highest frequency of use also have the highest likelihood of attrition, even after controlling for other correlates of missingness. There is a large body of literature on missing not at random (MNAR) analysis models for longitudinal data, particularly in the ﬁeld of biostatistics. Because these methods allow for a relationship between the outcome variable and the propensity for missing data, they require a weaker assumption about the missing data mechanism. This article describes 2 classic MNAR modeling approaches for longitudinal data: the selection model and the pattern mixture model. To date, these models have been slow to migrate to the social sciences, in part because they required complicated custom computer programs. These models are now quite easy to estimate in popular structural equation modeling programs, particularly Mplus. The purpose of this article is to describe these MNAR modeling frameworks and to illustrate their application on a real data set. Despite their potential advantages, MNAR-based analyses are not without problems and also rely on untestable assumptions. This article offers practical advice for implementing and choosing among different longitudinal models.},
