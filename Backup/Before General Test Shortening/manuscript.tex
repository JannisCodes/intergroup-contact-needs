% Migrant Example Pathways
\textbf{Relevance (Version 1 of 2): Migrant Example Version:}

Conflict between social groups and their individual members remains a prevalent feature of the modern human condition. One of the main examples to date are the struggles of many migrants across the world, hoping to build a positive relationship with the majority group. One of the main ameliorations proposed by social psychologists has been the intergroup contact hypothesis. In its most essential interpretation, the intergroup contact hypothesis postulates that prejudice can be reduced and favorable attitudes increased if members of two groups have frequent and positive contact \citep[e.g.,][]{Allport1954b, Hewstone1996, Pettigrew1998}. Over the past 70 years, a plethora of studies and interventions have shown the general effectiveness of positive intergroup contact \citep[e.g.,][]{Pettigrew2006}. However, even though a central assumption of intergroup contact theory has been that the contact should be positive, relatively little research has thus far explained when and why people perceive their everyday inter-group interactions as positive.

% Full Migrant Pathway
\textbf{Relevance (Version 2 of 2): Full Migrant Focus Version:}

The adaptation of migrants in new cultural contexts has become an important issue for many societies around the world. A major aspect of such migrant adaptation arguably unfolds during the daily interactions migrants have with the cultural majority members \citep{Maxwell2017, Sam2010}. One of the main social psychological theories proposed for understanding how contact between groups functions has been the ’intergroup contact hypothesis’. In its most essential interpretation, the intergroup contact hypothesis postulates that prejudice can be reduced and favorable attitudes increased if members of two groups have frequent and positive contact \citep[e.g.,][]{Allport1954b, Hewstone1996, Pettigrew1998}. Over the past 70 years, a plethora of studies and interventions have shown the general effectiveness of positive intergroup contact \citep[e.g.,][]{Pettigrew2006}. However, even though a central assumption of intergroup contact theory has been that the contact should be positive, relatively little research has thus far explained when and why people perceive their everyday inter-group interactions as positive.

% Old Relevance: Conflict is a problem, positive contact as solution, but little research on when daily contact is perceived positive
%Conflict between social groups and their individual members remains a prevalent feature of the modern human condition. Experiences of prejudices, discrimination, and animosities with other groups continue to plague the everyday lives of many people around the world. One of the main ameliorations proposed by social psychologists has been the intergroup contact hypothesis. In its most essential interpretation, the intergroup contact hypothesis postulates that frequent and positive contact with an out-group reduces prejudice and increases favorable attitudes towards the other group \citep[e.g.,][]{Allport1954b, Hewstone1996, Pettigrew1998}. And even though over the past 70 years, a plethora of studies and interventions have shown the general effectiveness of positive intergroup contact \citep[e.g.,][]{Pettigrew2006}, relatively little research has thus far explained when and why people's everyday inter-group interactions are perceived as positive.

% Problem v.02: theoretical interaction quality central to understanding outcomes, practical many impactful negative interactions in everyday life
\textbf{Problem Illustration Paragraph:}

Importantly, not understanding when and why an interaction is perceived as positive presents substantial theoretical and practical obstacles. There is now consistent evidence that negative intergroup contacts lead to worse attitudes, prejudice, and future interaction motivation \citep[e.g.,][]{Barlow2012, Prati2021, Graf2014}. Theoretically, understanding whether an interaction is perceived as positive or negative (i.e., interaction quality) thus sits at the heart of when the intergroup contact hypothesis is successful (e.g., Brown et al. \citeyear{Brown2007}, Tropp et al. \citeyear{Tropp2016}; also cf. Allport’s original sentiment, Allport \citeyear{Allport1954b}). Practically, policymakers and practitioners are thus far often under-prepared to deal with the occurrences of negative interactions, especially in every-day life contexts. Understanding the psychological mechanisms of when and why interactions are perceived as positive is, thus, an important issue for understanding whether an interaction leads to better intergroup perceptions, especially during everyday interactions outside the lab.

% Aim / Solution v.02: look at need fulfillment as mechanism in daily interactions of migrants
\textbf{Proposal Paragraph:}

In this article, we propose that the fulfillment of fundamental psychological needs might offer a psycho-social mechanism for understanding and explaining contact quality and positive outgroup attitudes. That is to say, that if a person, for example, seeks to feel accepted by their interaction partner and this need is fulfilled during the interaction, the person should rate the interaction and the group of the interaction partner more favorably. To test this, we collected three sets of real-life data from recent immigrants, tracking situational needs, interaction quality, and outgroup attitudes, following their daily interactions with majority group members. 

\section{Need Mechanism in Intergroup Contact}
% Motivational mechanism:
% interaction quality is important
% past research has either focused on conditions or cognitive-affective processes
% neither are necessary or explain why an interaction is positive

Several meta-analytic reviews found that positive intergroup contact reduces prejudice and increases positive attitudes in experimental and cross-sectional studies \citep[][]{Tropp2005, Pettigrew2006, Davies2011}, as well as in intergroup contact interventions outside the lab \citep[][]{Beelmann2014, Lemmer2015}. It is widely accepted that equal status, common goals, collaboration, and structural support during the interaction form the optimal conditions for such positive contact effects \citep[Allport's Optimal Contact conditions;][]{Allport1954b, Pettigrew1969}. However, a major meta-analysis of these contact conditions showed that contact resulted in more positive intergroup relations even when Allport's conditions were not met \citep[][]{Pettigrew2006}. It, thus, remains unclear when and why exactly an interaction is perceived as positive and what factors (beyond Allport's conditions) explain positive contact effects\footnote{It should be noted here that following Allport's original conditions, several additional conditions of optimal contact were proposed \citep[for a critical discussion see][]{Pettigrew1986}. Similarly, since the early 21\textsuperscript{st} century many psychological processes during intergroup contact were examined \citep[e.g. see,][]{Paolini2021}. Among others, researchers have for example explored different forms of social categorizations \citep[][]{Pettigrew1998}, the salience of social categories \citep[][]{Brown2005}, intimacy \citep[e.g.,][]{Marinucci2021} and attachment \citep[e.g.,][]{Tropp2021}, threat and intergroup anxiety \citep[e.g.,][]{Stephan2008, Paolini2004}, and to a lesser extent knowledge about the other group \citep[][]{Pettigrew2008c}. However, all these advances share the underlying criticism that they are not geared towards understanding when and why an interaction is perceived as positive.}. We propose that we may look to the literature on motivation and psychological needs to understand when and why exactly an interaction is perceived as positive.

% ALTERNATIVE: SHORTER BUT NOT FOCUSED ON ALLPORT'S CONDITIONS (WHICH WE TEST LATER)
% Several meta-analytic reviews found that positive intergroup contact reduces prejudice and increases positive attitudes in experimental and cross-sectional studies \citep[][]{Tropp2005, Pettigrew2006, Davies2011}, as well as in intergroup contact interventions outside the lab \citep[][]{Beelmann2014, Lemmer2015}. Past research has either focused on conditions under which interactions tend to have favorable effects \citep[e.g., Allport's optimal conditions;][]{Allport1954b, Pettigrew1969} or has investigated cognitive-affective processes during contact \citep[e.g., group salience, intimacy, attachment, or intergroup anxiety;][]{Brown2005, Marinucci2021, Tropp2021, Paolini2004}. However, neither the contact conditions nor the cognitive-affective processes are particularly well equipped to explain when and why an interaction will be perceived as positive. We propose that we may look to the literature on motivation and psychological needs to understand when and why exactly an interaction is perceived as positive.


% Important in broader field: needs have been found to be important in broader intergroup relations and interpersonal contact literature.
Although considerations of psychological needs and motivations have remained markedly absent within the intergroup contact literature, the concepts are in no way foreign to the broader topic of intergroup relations. Psychological needs have for example found fruitful utility in reconciliation research \citep[][]{Shnabel2008}, the study of minority's discrimination experiences \citep[][]{Celebi2017}, and in non-intergroup interactions \citep[][]{Downie2008}. 
% On the most general level, research on intergroup conflicts has, for example, shown that addressing the group-specific needs predicts willingness to reconcile with the other group \citep[][]{Shnabel2008}. For the case of refugee migrants in their relationship with a majority group, a recent study found that identity needs will buffer against discrimination experiences and will protect personal health \citep[][]{Celebi2017}. Additionally, within the field of interpersonal relations, we find first evidence that the fulfillment of fundamental psychological needs might predict perceived interaction quality in non-intergroup interactions \citep[][]{Downie2008}. 
% Promising for intergroup contact: Asked for in intergroup contact reviews and first research looked at social change
And even within the field of intergroup contact the idea of need fulfillment as a psychological mechanism is not entirely novel. \citet{Dovidio2017} in their narrative review have suggested that understanding psychological needs might be essential to constructive intergroup contact. And recently first empirical research has even found psychological need fulfillment during intergroup contacts to predict support for social change \citep[][]{Hassler2021}. There is thus initial evidence to suggest that need fulfillment during intergroup contact might offer a promising psychological mechanism to understand perceived interaction quality and positive outgroup attitudes. 

% Difficult to test general mechanism: Either consider too many needs (situationally relevant but not feasible) or too few (feasible but not transferable). Solution: ask for main need + rating of main need  
% MAYBE MOVE THIS TO 'The Present Research Section'
One reason why motivational considerations might have remained absent from the intergroup contact literature is that there is an overwhelming number of individual needs or goals that might be relevant to a person during an intergroup interaction. Researchers considering the motivational content would, thus, either test few hyper-specific needs that might not be transferable to other intergroup contexts or they may need to assess a broad range of fundamental psychological needs. To avoid this predicament we propose to start by using adaptive and responsive survey designs that allow a tailored approach based on the participants inputs \citep[e.g.,][]{Tourangeau2017}. In particular, we propose to ask the participants to report their main goal during the interaction in a short open-ended question (i.e., situation core need) and with reference to their own response the participants can then indicate how much this need was fulfilled during the interaction (i.e., need fulfillment). Such an adaptive approach would allow us to test the fundamental psychological mechanism of whether situational psychological needs indeed predict perceived interaction quality and positive outgroup attitudes. 

\section{Real-Life Process Data}
While we have argued that a need fulfillment mechanism is relevant to intergroup contact generally, its flexible and broad applicability might be ideally suited to address the pressing issue of understanding natural intergroup contacts outside the lab. Investigations of such 'real-life interactions' often suffer from the difficulty that past intergroup contact research has either focused on the mechanisms of individual interactions in artificial lab studies or has focused on longer-term recall self-reports of natural interactions \citep[e.g.,][]{Pettigrew2006}. Even with extended intervention studies, the most fine-grained data available is usually limited to pre-post-control designs. Such empirical practices stand, however, in stark contrast to many of the theoretical advances that have focused on the dynamic nature of intergroup relations \citep[e.g.,][]{Pettigrew1998}, as well as the core idea of the contact hypothesis, which was focused on the daily interactions of people \citep[see][]{Allport1954b}. As a result, prominent figures within the intergroup contact field have called for studies that collect longitudinal \citep[][]{Pettigrew1998, Pettigrew2008, Pettigrew2008b, Pettigrew2011} and real-life experience-sampling data outside the lab \citep[][]{MacInnis2015, McKeown2017, Dixon2005}. Such data would be able to capture real-life interactions that include interaction-specific mechanism information close the actual experience\footnote{Additionally, such experience-sampling data can be collected close to the intergroup interactions and would, thus, largely mitigate recall biases. Moreover, because data is nested within participants, experience-sampling data often allows to capture large amounts of high-quality data with relatively few participants.}.

% Used to be difficult but technological and methodological developments (e.g., FormR + HLM) → collect large body of intensive longitudinal data
In the past, such data collections were often unfeasible because they were either physically impractical or too expensive. However, recent technological developments allow us to easily collect experience sampling data on mobile devices \citep[e.g.,][]{Keil2020} or using web-based applications \citep[e.g.,][]{Arslan2020}. At the same time, analytical methods for such more complex data have become more readily available, making the analyses more approachable \citep[see, e.g.,][]{ODonnell2021}. Given these, technological and methodological developments, we were able to collect a large amount of real-life data following the daily intergroup interactions of recent migrants with the majority group members.  

\section{The Present Research}
The aim of this paper is essentially threefold. First, our study is among the first to test the fundamental tenets of intergroup contact and Allport's conditions in real-life extensive longitudinal data. Second, we test whether the fulfillment situational psychological needs is meaningfully related to more positive outgroup attitudes following intergroup interactions. And third, we test the role of interaction quality in  the relationship of psychological need fulfillment and outgroup attitudes. Based on this we formulated three main hypotheses:
\begin{enumerate}[label=H\arabic*:]
    \item Based on the most general understanding of the contact hypothesis, an increase in frequency and quality of contact should jointly account for changes in more favorable outgroup attitudes across extensive longitudinal data.
    \item Based on Allport’s optimal contact conditions, intergroup interactions with equal status, common goals, collaboration, and structural support should predict more favorable outgroup attitudes due to more positive interaction quality perceptions within the extensive longitudinal data.
    \item Based on our proposal, intergroup interactions with higher situational core need fulfillment should predict more favorable outgroup attitudes due to more positive interaction quality perceptions within the extensive longitudinal data.
\end{enumerate}
Beyond these main hypotheses we have formulated several sub-hypotheses that form the basis for our analysis plan (these sub-hypotheses also include several robustness checks and are available in Appendix \ref{app:AppendixHypotheses}). Given the more complex data structure of the extensive longitudinal data, we opted to test our hypotheses using a multilevel regression model, where the measurement occasions (level 1) were nested within the participants (level 2). Given that more complex dynamic modeling procedures are not necessary to test these more basic hypotheses, we will focus on the contemporaneous effect of the data (e.g., need fulfillment during the intergroup interaction predicts outgroup attitudes following the interaction). Such an approach is also tolerant to missing data and uneven case numbers within participants.

To test our main hypotheses, we collected three independent sets of extensive longitudinal data (Studies 1–3). The full surveys are available in Supplementary Materials A as well as in our open science repository (including a complete codebook, see OSF-REFERENCE). Our most comprehensive study (Study 3) was fully preregistered  \citep[available at][]{Kreienkamp2021f}. The fully annotated analyses are available in Supplementary Material B. As is common with multilevel analyses, we use a hierarchical modeling approach and always report the final model in-text (for the full modeling process see Supplementary Material B).

\section{Study 1}

Based on our main hypotheses, the aim of our first study is to
specifically test the general contact hypothesis, the influence of core
need fulfillment, and perceived interaction quality during intergroup
contacts. To this aim, we conducted an intensive longitudinal survey
study with recent migrants to the Netherlands. Data was collected from
May 5\textsuperscript{th} through June 6\textsuperscript{th}, 2018 (and
all participants started the study within the first two days).

The full surveys are available in our Online Supplementary Material A
and the full data description is available in Online Supplementary
Materials B. Correlations and descriptive statistics of the included
variables are available in Table \ref{tab:descrFullLong} and Table
\ref{tab:descrOutLong}.

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

After receiving ethical approval from the University of Groningen, we
recruited 23 migrants using the local paid participant pool and
specifically targeted non-Dutch migrants to participate in our study.
Participants reported on their interactions for at least 30 days with
two daily measures (capturing the morning and afternoon). With this
design, we aimed at getting 50-60 measurements per participant
(\textit{M} = 53.26, \textit{SD} = 16.72, \textit{total N} = 1225). This
is a common number of measurements found in experience sampling studies
and offers sufficient power to model processes within and between
participants \citep[e.g., for a systematic review see][]{AanhetRot2012}.
Participants were compensated for their participation with up to 34
Euros -- each two Euros for pre- and post-questionnaire as well as 50
Eurocents for every experience sampling measurement occasion. The sample
consisted of relatively young, educated, and western migrants from the
global north (\(M_{age}\) = 24.35, \(SD_{age}\) = 4.73, 19 women, 15
students). The sample accurately describes one of the largest groups of
migrants in the region \citep[][]{GemeenteGroningen2015}.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

The study itself consisted of three main parts, an introductory
pre-measurement, and the daily experience sampling measurements, as well
as a concluding post-measurement. After giving informed consent,
participants started by filling in an online pre-questionnaire assessing
demographics and general information about their immigration. Over the
next thirty days, the participants then were invited twice a day (at 12
pm and 7pm) to reflect upon their interactions, psychological need
fulfillments, and current attitudes towards the Dutch outgroup
(\textit{median duration} = 2M 22S, \textit{MAD duration} = 1M 19S).
General compliance was high (85.90\% of all invited surveys were filled
in)\footnote{Two participants completed only two days (among the others, participation was 93.70\%)}.
The response rates were approximately equal during mornings (\textit{n}
= 621) and afternoons (\textit{n} = 604) and most measurements were
completed within four hours of the invitation. After the final day of
daily diary measurements, participants were invited to fill in a longer
post measurement survey that mirrored the pre-measurement. All key
variables for this study were part of the short daily diary surveys.

\subsubsection{Materials}

\paragraph{Intergroup Contact}

To test the prerequisite effect of intergroup contact, every experience
sampling measurement started with the question
``\textit{Did you meet a Dutch person this morning [/afternoon]? (In person interaction for at least 10 minutes)}''.
Our participants recorded between 2--51 (3.23--91.07\% of individual
daily diary measurements; 31.59\% of all 1225 daily diary
responses)\footnote{Two participants only recorded two daily diary measurements each and non of these included outgroup contacts. These participants are removed from any analyses including outgroup contacts.}.

\paragraph{Psychological Needs}

Irrespective of whether participants had an interaction with Dutch
people or not, everyone answered a short series of questions on
psychological need fulfillment. However, whereas participants with
interactions reported on the need fulfillment during the interaction,
people without interactions with Dutch people judged the past daytime
period in general. To assess the fulfillment of psychological needs, we
included two types of need measurement: (1) the core situational need
and (2) general self-determination theory needs.

For the core situational need, we asked participants in an open ended
text field:
``\textit{What was your most important goal [during the interaction / this morning / this afternoon]?}''.
Then, with reference to the text entry, we asked how much this core need
was fulfilled during the interaction or the past daytime period:
``\textit{[The interaction / You] fulfilled your goal: [-previous text entry-]}''
on a continuous slider scale ranging from strongly disagree (-50) to
strongly agree (+50).

We, additionally, included a common measure of three self-determination
theory needs \citep[see][]{Downie2008}. The items were introduced either
by ``\textit{During the interaction:}'' or
``\textit{This morning [/afternoon]:}'' and measured autonomy
(``\textit{I was myself.}''), competence
(``\textit{I felt competent.}''), and relatedness (without intergroup
contact ``\textit{I had a strong need to belong}''; with intergroup
contact: ``\textit{I shared information about myself.}'' and
``\textit{The other(s) shared information about themselves.}''). All
items were rated on a continuous slider scale from very little (-50) to
a great deal (+50).

\paragraph{Perceived Interaction Quality}

As an explanatory mechanism, we assessed ratings of the perceived
interaction quality. As our main measurement, participants rated the
statement ``\textit{Overall the interaction was …}'' on two continuous
slider scales measuring pleasantness
\citep[from unpleasant (-50) to pleasant (+50)) and meaningfulness (from superficial (-50) to meaningful (+50); both items adapted from][]{Downie2008}.

\paragraph{Outgroup Attitudes}

At the end of every daily diary measurement we asked all participants
about their current attitudes towards the Dutch -- our main dependent
variable. To assess the momentary outgroup evaluation we used the common
feeling thermometer: ``How favorable do you feel towards the Dutch?''
\citep[][]{Lavrakas2008}. Participants then rated their attitude on a
continuous slider scale from ``very cold -- 0'' through ``no feeling --
50'' to ``very warm -- 100''. Both the question phrasing as well as the
tick labels were consistent with large-scale panel surveys
\citep[e.g.,][]{DeBell2010}.

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Contact Hypothesis}

We tested the most general contact hypothesis in two steps. First, we
assessed whether more intergroup interactions were related to to more
positive outgroup attitudes. Second, we tested whether a potential
positive effect on outgroup attitudes depended on the interaction
quality (jointly with the number of interactions). We find that neither
the number of interactions nor the number of daily diary responses with
an interaction were significantly related with the average outgroup
attitudes (all \textbar{} \textit{r} \textbar{} \textless{} 0.03, all
\textit{p} \textgreater{} 0.887). This is to say that within our data,
participants with more outgroup interactions did not have significantly
more positive outgroup attitudes. This might be due to the aggregation
within the participants or the small sample size of between participant
data. Nonetheless, the aggregated data does not support the notion that
simply having more interactions with an outgroup results in more
positive outgroup attitudes.

However, despite the missing relationship with the number of
interactions, we find a medium sized correlation between the
participants' Average Interaction Quality and their Average Outgroup
Attitudes. Thus within our data participants with a higher quality
outgroup interactions also held more positive attitudes towards that
group. And when considering the number of interactions and average
interaction quality jointly in a linear regression, we additionally find
a statistically significant interaction term (\textit{b} = -0.05,
\textit{t}(17) = -2.95, \textit{p} = 0.009, \(\eta_p^2\) = 0.34).
Looking at a floodlight analysis of the effect, we find that in our
sample with an increasing number of interactions the positive effect of
average interaction quality becomes weaker. However, it should be noted
that this is based on data aggregating all within participant nuances
and is only based on 21 people.

We additionally used a multilevel regression to check whether having an
interaction with an outgroup member had a situational (i.e.,
contemporaneous) effect within the participants. We find that having an
outgroup interaction is indeed associated with significantly more
positive outgroup attitudes within the participants (\textit{b} = 2.48,
\textit{t}(1200) = 4.36, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}1.36, 3.59{]}), even after controlling for having an
interaction with a non-Dutch (which did not relate to outgroup attitudes
independently; For full results see Online Supplementary Materials
B)\footnote{Interestingly, adding random slopes to this model did not explain additional variance. This is unusual and might indicate the the effect is very consistent across participants. However, the small number of participants, or other measurement issues provide an alternative explanation}.
Thus, in our first data we find mixed results, where outgroup contacts
show a positive effect on outgroup attitudes in the moment but these
results do not translate into average differences between participants,
keeping in mind that the between-participant analyses in the aggregated
form are based on a small sample size.

\subsubsection{Core Need}

The main proposal of our article is that the success of an outgroup
interaction might be explained by whether or not the interaction
fulfilled the person's core situational need. This should, in turn, be
due to a higher perceived interaction quality. We sequentially test
whether the fulfillment of the core need during an interaction is (1)
related to more positive outgroup attitudes, (2) higher perceived
interaction quality, and (3) whether the variance explained by the core
need is assumed by the perceived interaction quality if considered
jointly.

We find that in the highest multilevel models, the fulfillment of core
situational needs during outgroup contacts was associated with more
positive outgroup attitudes (random slopes model; \textit{b} = 0.17,
\textit{t}(365) = 2.93, \textit{p} = 0.004, \textit{95\%CI}{[}0.06,
0.29{]}) and also predicted higher perceived interaction quality (random
intercept model; \textit{b} = 0.42, \textit{t}(365) = 8.07, \textit{p}
\textless{} .001, \textit{95\%CI}{[}0.32, 0.52{]}). Moreover, when we
consider the influences of core need fulfillment and interaction quality
on outgroup attitudes jointly, we find that virtually all variance is
explained by perceived interaction quality (random slopes mode;
\textit{b} = 0.23, \textit{t}(364) = 4.22, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.12, 0.33{]}) and only little unique variance is
still explained by core need fulfillment (\textit{b} = 0.04,
\textit{t}(364) = 0.64, \textit{p} = 0.523, \textit{95\%CI}{[}-0.08,
0.15{]}). We thus find support for our hypotheses and can conclude that
in this data set the fulfillment of core situational needs had a
significant influence on outgroup attitudes. Additionally, this effect
is likely being explained by its effect through perceived interaction
quality.

\faQuestionCircle~Are we sure that we don't want some sort of
bootstrapped indirect effect?

\subsubsection{Robustness}

To build further confidence in our results, we assessed two additional
models that might offer alternative explanations. First, to ensure that
the effect of core need fulfillment is specific to an actual
interaction, we compared the effect to core need fulfillement in
situations without an interaction. For this, we analyzed the generalized
situational core need fulfillment (either during an interaction or about
the daytime in general) and tested whether the effect differed during
daily diary measurements with and without outgroup contacts. We found no
main effect of core need fulfillment (random slopes model; \textit{b} =
-0.10, \textit{t}(1199) = -2.22, \textit{p} = 0.026,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}-0.18, -0.01{]}) but a significant interaction effect
of core need fulfillment and outgroup contact (\textit{b} = 0.13,
\textit{t}(1199) = 4.31, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.07, 0.18{]}). Together with a significant main
effect of having an outgroup contact, this indicates that it is not key
need fulfillment in general --- but only key need fulfillment during an
outgroup contact that predicts more positive outgroup attitudes.

In a final step, we controlled for other fundamental psychological needs
during the interaction. We focus on the three commonly considered self
determination needs: competence, autonomy, and relatedness. We find that
the core need adds significantly above a model with only the self
determination theory needs (random slopes models; \(\chi^2\)(6,
\textit{N} = 21) = 19.60, \textit{p} = 0.003). We find that next to
relatedness (\textit{b} = 0.10, \textit{t}(361) = 4.04, \textit{p}
\textless{} .001, \textit{95\%CI}{[}0.05, 0.14{]}), the core need
explains the most variance in outgroup attitudes after an outgroup
contact (\textit{b} = 0.09, \textit{t}(361) = 2.23, \textit{p} = 0.026,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.01, 0.18{]}). When compared to the model with only
the SDT needs, the core need fulfillment flexibly takes on some of the
explained variance of all three fundamental needs (competence and
autonomy needs turning non-significant; all \textit{b} \textless{} 0.05,
all \textit{p} \textgreater{} 0.544). For full results see Online
Supplementary Information B.

\section{Study 2}

The aim of Study 2 is similar to Study 1, as we again test the general
contact hypothesis, the influence of core need fulfillment, and
perceived interaction quality during intergroup contacts. However, in
this second study we collected a substantially larger sample of
international students who recently arrived in the Netherlands and also
improved the study design (e.g., pop up explanations described later).
The survey method again offers a large body of ecologically valid data
on need satisfaction in real-life intergroup contact situations as these
students will likely interact with the Dutch majority outgroup on a
daily basis. Data was collected from November 19\textsuperscript{th},
2018 through January 6\textsuperscript{th}, 2019.

The full surveys are available in our Online Supplementary Material A
and the full data description is available in Online Supplementary
Materials B. Correlations and descriptive statistics of the included
variables are available in Table \ref{tab:descrFullLong} and Table
\ref{tab:descrOutLong}.

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

After receiving ethical approval from the University of Groningen, we
recruited 113 international students using a local participant pool. We
specifically targeted non-Dutch students, who had recently arrived in
the Netherlands. Participants reported on their interactions for at
least 30 days with two daily measures (capturing the morning and
afternoon). With this design, we aimed at getting 50-60 measurements per
participant (\textit{M} = 43.94, \textit{SD} = 15.00, \textit{total N} =
4965). As with the previous study this should offer sufficient power to
model processes within participants and will lend stronger weight to
between-participant results. Participants were compensated for their
participation with partial course credits --- depending on their
participation. The sample consisted of relatively young migrants, who
were mostly from the global north (\(M_{age}\) = 20.24, \(SD_{age}\) =
2.12, 84 women). The sample fairly accurately describes the local
population of international students.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

The study procedure mirrored the setup of study one and consisted of
pre-, daily diary-, and post-measurement. The participants were invited
for daily diary measurements twice a day (at 12 pm and 7pm) for 30 days
(\textit{median duration} = 3M 46S, \textit{MAD duration} = 1M 54S).
General compliance was high (70.87\% of all invited surveys were filled
in). The response rates were approximately equal during mornings
(\textit{n} = 2608) and afternoons (\textit{n} = 2357). All key
variables for this study were part of the short daily diary surveys.

\subsubsection{Materials}

\paragraph{Intergroup Contact}

To measure intergroup contacts, every experience sampling measurement
started with the question
``\textit{Did you meet a Dutch person this morning [/afternoon]? (in-person interaction for at least 10 minutes)}''.
Participants were additionally offered a pop-up explanation: ``With
in-person interaction, we mean a continued interaction with another
person (potentially in a group) that lasted at least 10 minutes. This
interaction should be offline and face-to-face. It should include some
form of verbal communication and should be uninterrupted to still count
as the same interaction. Any individual interaction can last minutes or
hours. If there were multiple interaction partners, we would like you to
focus on the person that was most important to you during the
interaction.''. The participants recorded between 1--43 interactions
with Dutch majority people (1.64--93.75\% of individual daily diary
measurements; 18.83\% of all 4965 daily diary responses).

\paragraph{Psychological Needs}

For the core situational need, we asked participants in an open ended
text field:
``\textit{What was your main goal [during the interaction with X / this morning / this afternoon]?}''.
Participants could additionally click on a pop-up explanation: ``Your
main goal during an interaction can vary depending on the interaction.
It could be to connect with friends, to find or provide help, to achieve
academic ambitions, work on your fitness, work for a job, or simply to
get a coffee, just as well as many many other concrete or abstract goals
that are import to you in the moment. It really depends on your
subjective experience of the interaction.''. Then, with reference to the
text entry, we asked how much this core need was fulfilled during the
interaction or the past daytime period:
``\textit{During your interaction with X [this morning / this evening] your goal (-previous text entry-) was fulfilled.}''
on a continuous slider scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to
strongly agree (100).

The measurement of the self determination needs was identical to study
1.

\paragraph{Perceived Interaction Quality}

The ratings of the perceived interaction quality was identical to study
one.

\paragraph{Outgroup Attitudes}

As in Study 1, attitudes towards the Dutch majority outgroup were again
measured using the feeling thermometer. All survey details are also
available in Online Supplemental Materials A and B.

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Contact Hypothesis}

We tested the most general contact hypothesis in two steps. First, we
assessed whether more intergroup interactions were related to to more
positive outgroup attitudes. Second, we tested whether a potential
positive effect on outgroup attitudes depended on the interaction
quality (jointly with the number of interactions). We find a significant
correlation with average outgroup attitudes for both the total number of
outgroup interactions (\textit{r} = 0.22, \textit{p} = 0.019) and the
number of measurement beeps with an interaction (\textit{r} = 0.28,
\textit{p} = 0.003). This is to say that within our data, participants
with more outgroup interactions did have significantly more positive
outgroup attitudes. This is inconsistent with the results we found in
the first study and might be due to the larger number of participants.

However, we find no significant correlation between the participants'
Average Interaction Quality and their Average Outgroup Attitudes
(\textit{r} = 0.04, \textit{p} = 0.679). Thus, when considering the
number of interactions and average interaction quality jointly in a
linear regression, we find a main effect of intergroup contacts to
predict outgroup attitudes (\textit{b} = 0.81, \textit{t}(109) = 3.29,
\textit{p} = 0.001, \(\eta_p^2\) = 0.08). Given the missing aggregate
relationship between average interaction quality and outgroup attitudes,
we find no significant effect of average perceived contact quality. We
also do not find that in this sample the impact of the number of
interactions is moderated by the average contact quality. This is not
entirely consistent with the first study, where average contact quality
did have a meaningful effect on outgroup attitudes. This finding is not
necessarily surprising given that the variables aggregate all within
person variation and there were substantially more measurements where
participants did not have an interaction (but reported their outgroup
attitudes) than measurements that followed an outgroup contact.

We additionally used a multilevel regression to check whether having an
interaction with an outgroup member had a situational (i.e.,
contemporaneous) effect within the participants. We find that having an
outgroup interaction is indeed associated with significantly more
positive outgroup attitudes within the participants (random slopes
model; \textit{b} = 2.99, \textit{t}(4850) = 3.80, \textit{p}
\textless{} .001, \textit{95\%CI}{[}1.45, 4.54{]}), even after
controlling for having an interaction with a non-Dutch person (which did
not relate to outgroup attitudes independently; For full results see
Online Supplementary Materials B). Thus, in our second dataset we find
mixed results, outgroup contacts show a positive effect on outgroup
attitudes in the moment and on average between participants. However, we
find that this effect does not depend on the average perceived
interaction quality. This unexpected results, might be due to the
aggregation process and the following analyses will focus in on the role
of the perceived interaction quality during an outgroup interaction.

\subsubsection{Core Need}

We again sequentially tested whether the fulfillment of the core need
during an interaction was (1) related to more positive outgroup
attitudes, (2) higher perceived interaction quality, and (3) whether the
variance explained by the core need is assumed by the perceived
interaction quality if considered jointly. We find that in the
multilevel models, the fulfillment of core situational needs during
outgroup contacts was associated with more positive outgroup attitudes
(random slopes model; \textit{b} = 0.13, \textit{t}(826) = 4.18,
\textit{p} \textless{} .001, \textit{95\%CI}{[}0.07, 0.19{]}) and also
predicted higher perceived interaction quality (random slopes model;
\textit{b} = 0.40, \textit{t}(826) = 6.46, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.28, 0.52{]}). Additionally, if we consider the
influences of core need fulfillment and interaction quality on outgroup
attitudes jointly, we find that virtually all variance is explained by
perceived interaction quality (random slopes mode; \textit{b} = 0.17,
\textit{t}(825) = 5.56, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.11, 0.23{]}) and only little unique variance is
still explained by core need fulfillment (\textit{b} = 0.03,
\textit{t}(825) = 1.47, \textit{p} = 0.141, \textit{95\%CI}{[}-0.01,
0.07{]}). These results are consistent with the results in study one and
we thus find support for our hypotheses and can conclude that in this
data set the fulfillment of core situational needs had a significant
influence on outgroup attitudes and that this effect is likely explained
by its effect through perceived interaction quality.

\faQuestionCircle~Are we sure that we don't want some sort of
bootstrapped indirect effect?

\subsubsection{Robustness}

We again checked for alternative models. First, when considering
generalized situational core need fulfillment together with whether an
intergroup contact took place, we find that there is only a minuscule
main effect of core need fulfillment (random slopes model; \textit{b} =
-0.03, \textit{t}(4849) = -1.34, \textit{p} = 0.181,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}-0.08, 0.02{]}) but a stronger interaction effect of
core need fulfillment and outgroup contact (\textit{b} = 0.06,
\textit{t}(4849) = 3.03, \textit{p} = 0.002, \textit{95\%CI}{[}0.02,
0.10{]}). Together with a significant main effect of having an outgroup
contact (\textit{b} = 2.88, \textit{t}(4849) = 3.71, \textit{p}
\textless{} .001, \textit{95\%CI}{[}1.36, 4.40{]}), this indicates that
it is not key need fulfillment in general --- but key need fulfillment
during an outgroup contact that predicts more positive outgroup
attitudes. This finding is consistent with the results of the previous
study, albeit with slightly weaker effect (likely because of the large
number of measurements that did not include an outgroup interaction).

In a final step we again checked whether during the interaction the core
situational need remains a meaningful predictor even when taking other
fundamental psychological needs into account. We find that the core need
adds significantly above a model with only the self determination theory
needs (random slopes models; \(\chi^2\)(6, \textit{N} = 108) = 22.90,
\textit{p} \textless{} .001). We find that the core need explains the
most variance in outgroup attitudes after an outgroup contact
(\textit{b} = 0.08, \textit{t}(823) = 2.95, \textit{p} = 0.003,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.03, 0.13{]}). When compared to the model with only
the SDT needs, the core need fulfillment flexibly takes on some of the
explained variance of all of the three fundamental needs. However,
different from the first study, relatedness (\textit{b} = 0.07,
\textit{t}(823) = 4.26, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.04, 0.10{]}) and autonomy (\textit{b} = 0.02,
\textit{t}(823) = 0.93, \textit{p} = 0.353, \textit{95\%CI}{[}-0.02,
0.08{]}) also predicted positive outgroup attitudes in this larger
sample. For full results see Online Supplementary Information B.

\section{Study 3}

The aim of this final study is to extend the previous studies by
additionally testing Allport's conditions in an extensive longitudinal
design and to compare the predictive powers of Allport's conditions and
the core situational need fulfillment. We will, thus, again test the
general contact hypothesis, the influence of core need fulfillment, and
perceived interaction quality during intergroup contacts. However, we
additionally have the opportunity to also assess the role of Allport's
conditions in this and to compare the two approaches (Allport's
conditions and core need fulfillment) directly.

For this study we specifically recruited international medical students,
because they represent a particular group of migrants who face
structural requirements to integrate and interact with Dutch majority
outgroup members on a daily basis. As part of their educational program,
the migrants are required to take language courses and interact with
patients as part of their medical internships and medical residency. The
extensive longitudinal survey method again offers a large body of
ecologically valid data on need satisfaction in real-life intergroup
contact situations. Data were collected from November
8\textsuperscript{th}, 2019 to January 10\textsuperscript{th}, 2020.

The full surveys are available in our Online Supplementary Material A
and the full data description is available in Online Supplementary
Materials B. Correlations and descriptive statistics of the included
variables are available in Tables \ref{tab:descrFullLong} and
\ref{tab:descrOutLong}.

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

After receiving ethical approval from the University of Groningen, we
recruited 71 international medical students using a contacts within the
University Medical Department and specifically targeted non-Dutch
students, who had recently arrived in the Netherlands. Participants
reported on their interactions for at least 30 days with two daily
measures (capturing the morning and afternoon). With this design, we
aimed at getting 50-60 measurements per participant (\textit{M} = 57.85,
\textit{SD} = 20.68, \textit{total N} = 4107). As with the previous
study this should offer sufficient power to model processes within
participants and will lend stronger weight to between-participant
results. Participants were compensated for their participation with
partial course credits --- depending on their participation. The sample
consisted of relatively young migrants, who were mostly from the global
north (\(M_{age}\) = 22.68, \(SD_{age}\) = 3.10, 59 women). The sample
fairly accurately describes the local population of international
students.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

The study procedure mirrored the setup of studies one and two, in that
it consisted of pre-, daily diary-, and post-measurement. The
participants were invited for daily diary measurements twice a day (at
12 pm and 7pm) for 30 days (\textit{median duration} = 4M 13S,
\textit{MAD duration} = 2M 6S). General compliance was high (93.30\%
filled daily diary surveys for 31 days or more NEED TO RE-CHECK THIS).
The response rates were approximately equal during mornings (\textit{n}
= 2092) and afternoons (\textit{n} = 2015). All key variables in for
this study were part of the short daily diary surveys.

\subsubsection{Materials}

\paragraph{Intergroup Contact}

The measurement of intergroup contacts was identical to study two. The
participants recorded between 1--71 interactions with Dutch outgroup
members (2.13--87.18\% of individual daily diary measurements; 41.44\%
of all 4107 daily diary responses).

\paragraph{Psychological Needs}

The measurement of the core situational need and its fulfillment was
identical to study two. Similarly, the measurement of the self
determination needs was identical to studies one and two.

\paragraph{Allport's Conditions}

To measure how much each of the interactions fulfilled Allport's
conditions of optimal contact we asked participants to rate how much the
interaction had equal status
(``\textit{The interaction with [name interaction partner] was on equal footing (same status)}''),
a common goal
(``\textit{[name interaction partner] shared your goal ([free-text entry interaction key need])}''),
support of authorities
(``\textit{The interaction with [name interaction partner] was voluntary}''),
and intergroup cooperation
(``\textit{The interaction with [name interaction partner] was cooperative}'').

\paragraph{Perceived Interaction Quality}

The ratings of the perceived interaction quality was identical to study
one.

\paragraph{Outgroup Attitudes}

Attitudes towards the Dutch majority outgroup was again measured using
the feeling thermometer, as in studies one and two. All survey details
are also available in Online Supplemental Materials A and B.

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Contact Hypothesis}

We tested the most general contact hypothesis in two steps. First, we
assessed whether more intergroup interactions were related to to more
positive outgroup attitudes. Second, we tested whether a potential
positive effect on outgroup attitudes depended on the interaction
quality (jointly with the number of interactions). We find no
significant correlation between intergroup contact and average outgroup
attitudes --- for neither the total number of outgroup interactions
(\textit{r} = 0.01, \textit{p} = 0.946) and the number of measurement
beeps with an interaction (\textit{r} = 0.13, \textit{p} = 0.291). This
is to say that within our data, participants with more outgroup
interactions did not have significantly more positive or negative
outgroup attitudes. This is again consistent with the results we found
in the first study but inconsitent with the significant relationship we
find in the second study.

However, we do find a significant correlation between the participants'
Average Interaction Quality and their Average Outgroup Attitudes
(\textit{r} = 0.25, \textit{p} = 0.036). Thus, when considering the
number of interactions and average interaction quality jointly in a
linear regression, we only find a main effect of average perceived
interaction quality on predict outgroup attitudes (\textit{b} = 0.36,
\textit{t}(67) = 2.22, \textit{p} = 0.030, \(\eta_p^2\) = 0.07). Given
the missing aggregate relationship between number of interactions and
outgroup attitudes, we find no significant effect of interactions
themselves nor do we find a significant interaction effect. This result
mirrors that of study one but is inconsistent with the second study. But
again this inconsistency is not necessarily surprising given that the
variables aggregate all within person variation and there were
substantially more measurements where participants did not have an
interaction (but reported their outgroup attitudes) than measurements
that followed an outgroup contact.

We additionally used a multilevel regression to check whether having an
interaction with an outgroup member had a situational (i.e.,
contemporaneous) effect within the participants. We find that having an
outgroup interaction is indeed associated with significantly more
positive outgroup attitudes within the participants (random slopes
model; \textit{b} = 5.63, \textit{t}(3834) = 6.61, \textit{p}
\textless{} .001, \textit{95\%CI}{[}3.97, 7.29{]}), even after
controlling for having an interaction with a non-Dutch (which did not
relate to outgroup attitudes independently; For full results see Online
Supplementary Materials B). Thus, in our third dataset we find some
mixed results, outgroup contacts are not significantly related to
outgroup attitudes on aggregate between participants and this effect is
also not suppressed by a average interaction quality (i.e., no
interaction effect). However, while the aggregate data is partly
inconsistent with the first two studies, the within person contemoranous
effect of intergroup contact is consistent across all three studies.

\subsubsection{Allport's Conditions}

We sequentially tested whether the fulfillment of Allport's Contact
Conditions was (1) related to more positive outgroup attitudes, (2)
higher perceived interaction quality, and (3) whether the variance
explained by Allport's Conditions is assumed by the perceived
interaction quality if considered jointly. We find that in the
multilevel models, the fulfillment of Allport's Conditions during
outgroup contacts was associated with more positive outgroup attitudes
(random slopes model; \textit{b} = 0.22, \textit{t}(1601) = 5.86,
\textit{p} \textless{} .001, \textit{95\%CI}{[}0.15, 0.29{]}) and also
predicted higher perceived interaction quality (random slopes model;
\textit{b} = 0.65, \textit{t}(1605) = 11.82, \textit{p} \textless{}
.001, \textit{95\%CI}{[}0.54, 0.76{]}). Moreover, when we consider the
influences of Allport's Conditions and interaction quality on outgroup
attitudes jointly, we find that perceived interaction quality is a
substantially stronger predictor (random slopes mode; \textit{b} = 0.17,
\textit{t}(1600) = 6.25, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.12, 0.23{]}) and the unique variance explained by
Allport's Conditions was less than half of its original effect size
(\textit{b} = 0.09, \textit{t}(1600) = 2.89, \textit{p} = 0.004,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.03, 0.15{]}). These results indicate that in this
dataset the the fulfillment of Allport's conditions had a significant
influence on outgroup attitudes and this effect is likely in parts
explained by its effect through perceived interaction quality.

\faQuestionCircle~Are we sure that we don't want some sort of
bootstrapped indirect effect?

\subsubsection{Core Need}

We again sequentially tested whether the fulfillment of the core need
during an interaction was (1) related to more positive outgroup
attitudes, (2) higher perceived interaction quality, and (3) whether the
variance explained by the core need is assumed by the perceived
interaction quality if considered jointly. We find that in the
multilevel models, the fulfillment of core need fulfillment during
outgroup contacts was associated with more positive outgroup attitudes
(random slopes model; \textit{b} = 0.19, \textit{t}(1601) = 5.29,
\textit{p} \textless{} .001, \textit{95\%CI}{[}0.12, 0.27{]}) and also
predicted higher perceived interaction quality (random slopes model;
\textit{b} = 0.43, \textit{t}(1605) = 8.35, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.33, 0.54{]}). Additionally, once we consider the
influences of core need fulfillment and interaction quality on outgroup
attitudes jointly, we find that perceived interaction quality is a
substantially stronger predictor (random slopes mode; \textit{b} = 0.17,
\textit{t}(1600) = 6.86, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.12, 0.22{]}) and the unique variance explained by
core need fulfillment was roughly half of its original effect size
(\textit{b} = 0.11, \textit{t}(1600) = 3.50, \textit{p} \textless{}
.001, \textit{95\%CI}{[}0.05, 0.17{]}). These results indicate that in
this dataset the the fulfillment of core situational needs had a
significant influence on outgroup attitudes and this effect is likely in
parts explained by its effect through perceived interaction quality.

\faQuestionCircle~Are we sure that we don't want some sort of
bootstrapped indirect effect?

\subsubsection{Compare Fulfillment of Core Need and Allport's Conditions}

To compare the models using either Allport's conditions or the core need
fulfillment to predict outgroup attitudes, we first assess relative
model performance indices (i.e., Akaike information criterion, and
Bayesian information criterion), and then consider the two predictors in
a joint model to see whether the two approaches predict the same
variance in outgroup attitudes. When comparing the model selection
indices we find that the fulfillment of the situation core need, indeed
performs slightly better than the model using Allport's conditions
(\(AIC_{CoreNeed}\) 12632.02 \textless{} 12651.59 \(AIC_{Allport}\), and
\(BIC_{CoreNeed}\) 12664.55 \textless{} 12684.12 \(BIC_{Allport}\)).
Additionally, when considering the predictors jointly, we find that both
significantly predict outgroup attitudes with similar sized regression
parameters (random slopes model; Allport's Conditions: \textit{b} =
0.16, \textit{t}(1600) = 4.92, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.09, 0.24{]}, Core Need: \textit{b} = 0.14,
\textit{t}(1600) = 3.85, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.08, 0.17{]}). This indicates that, although both
Allport's conditions and the core need fulfillment seem to (in part)
work through perceived interaction quality, they explain different
aspects of the variance in outgroup attitudes and do not constitute one
another.

\subsubsection{Robustness}

We again checked for alternative models to the core need fulfillment.
First, when considering generalized situational core need fulfillment
together with whether an intergroup contact took place, we find that
there is no significant main effect of core need fulfillment (random
slopes model; \textit{b} = 0.03, \textit{t}(3835) = 1.51, \textit{p} =
0.131, \textit{95\%CI}{[}-0.01, 0.06{]}) but a stronger interaction
effect of core need fulfillment and outgroup contact (\textit{b} = 0.17,
\textit{t}(3835) = 7.32, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.12, 0.21{]}). Together with a significant main
effect of having an outgroup contact (\textit{b} = 5.41,
\textit{t}(3835) = 6.36, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}3.74, 7.08{]}), this indicates that it is not key need
fulfillment in general --- but key need fulfillment during an outgroup
contact that predicts more positive outgroup attitudes. This finding is
consistent with the results of the previous studies.

In a final step we again checked whether during the interaction the core
situational need remains a meaningful predictor even when taking other
fundamental psychological needs into account. We find that the core need
adds significantly above a model with only the self determination theory
needs (random slopes models; \(\chi^2\)(6, \textit{N} = 70) = 100.20,
\textit{p} \textless{} .001). We find that the core need explains the
most variance in outgroup attitudes after an outgroup contact
(\textit{b} = 0.15, \textit{t}(1598) = 3.88, \textit{p} \textless{}
.001, \textit{95\%CI}{[}0.07, 0.22{]}). When compared to the model with
only the SDT needs, the core need fulfillment flexibly takes on some of
the explained variance of all of the three fundamental needs. However,
similar to the previous study, in this large sample relatedness
(\textit{b} = 0.05, \textit{t}(1598) = 3.31, \textit{p} \textless{}
.001, \textit{95\%CI}{[}0.02, 0.09{]}), competence (\textit{b} = 0.06,
\textit{t}(1598) = 2.73, \textit{p} = 0.006, \textit{95\%CI}{[}0.02,
0.10{]}) and autonomy (\textit{b} = 0.04, \textit{t}(1598) = 2.12,
\textit{p} = 0.034, \textit{95\%CI}{[}-0.01, 0.08{]}) each also
predicted positive outgroup attitudes independently. However, the
regression coefficient is three times as large for the core need
fulfillment (with all scaling being equal). For full results see Online

\section{Discussion}
% aims re-iterated
In this paper we set out to (1) test the basic predictions of the intergroup contact hypothesis and Allport's optimal conditions in real-life extensive longitudinal data, (2) we proposed that the fulfillment situational psychological needs meaningfully predicts positive outgroup attitudes, and (3) that the fulfillment of psychological needs (and Allport's conditions) have their effect (partially) through perceived interaction quality. 

% Contact hypothesis in ESM data [inconsistent in aggregate but consistent in ML analysis]
When considering the results of the three studies jointly, we find mixed results for the basic intergroup contact hypothesis. The aggregated number of outgroup interactions across all measurements only had a significant effect on average outgroup attitudes in one of the three studies and in that study there was no significant effect of average interaction quality on outgroup attitudes (which was significant for the other two studies). This meant that only for our smallest study did we find the expected interaction between interaction frequency and interaction quality when looking at the aggregated data across all measurements. However, once we considered the effect of having an interaction with an outgroup member (vs. not having an outgroup interaction) within the participants, we find that intergroup contact is a strong predictor of outgroup attitudes across all three studies (even when taking other non-outgroup interactions into account). While this later results is in line with our expectations, the earlier aggregate findings are surprising because most past cross-sectional studies that have investigated the effect of interaction frequency have also considered an aggregate measurement (albeit not one from actual daily reports). Even though this inconsistency with past research might be a data artefact (e.g., because most people reported more substantially mode measurements during which they did not have an outgroup interaction), the absence of this aggregate effect could underline the fact that cross-sectional retrospective data might suffer from recall biases (e.g., where times with no outgroup interactions are undervalued by participants during the retrospective evaluations). In summary, we thus find that when we aggregate interaction frequencies and interaction quality from our intensive longitudinal data we find inconsistent results from the past literature but within participants intergroup contacts are significantly related with positive outgroup attitudes.

% Allport's conditions in ESM data [consistent predictor and partially through quality]
Using the data from our third study, we find that Allport's conditions are related to higher interaction quality perceptions and more positive outgroup attitudes. And when we consider interaction quality and Allport's conditions jointly, we find further evidence that part of the benefits of Allport's conditions are due to the case that such interactions are also perceived as more positive. We thus find first evidence that Allport's conditions of optimal contact are also relevant to the daily interactions recent migrants have in their interactions with majority group members. 

% Need fulfillment in intergroup contact [consistent predictor, through quality, slightly better than Allport and SDT]
Finally, when looking at the results for our main proposal regarding the importance of situational key needs, we find highly consistent positive results across all three studies. We find that in all three extensive longitudinal datasets, the fulfillment of core needs during intergroup contacts predicts higher interaction quality perceptions and more positive outgroup attitudes. We find that in all three studies the effect of core need fulfillment on outgroup attitudes is either fully or partially through its effect on quality perceptions, and we find that need fulfillment is an important predictor even when taking other fundamental psychological needs or Allport's conditions into account. In fact we find that our core situational needs measure predicted outgroup attitudes slightly better than Allport's conditions and consistently explained more variance in outgroup attitudes than any of the other psychological needs. In most cases the core need even took over the variances previously explained by the self-determination theory needs. We thus find strong evidence that within everyday life interactions of recent migrants with majority group members, the perception that one's interaction specific psychological needs are fulfilled offers a meaningful and flexible predictor of outgroup attitudes. As such the data offers a first test of the motivational basis of intergroup contact.

\subsection{Limitations}
to be discussed, potentially:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item migrants are not refugees (generalizability potentially even more relevant?)
    \item minority perspective only
    \item lagged effects left for future studies (potentially not relevant, time scale)
    \item ESM: real-life data comes at the expense of having short/single item operationalizations
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implications}
to be discussed, potentially:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item feasible to collect large amount of data on intergroup contact using ESM method (do we have a formR ref in there?; set up is feasible but not the easiest; maybe even advertise the reusability of the formR survey?)
    \item role of motivation in intergroup contact promising (potential for interventions, e.g., most immediate to the data: settlement practices). 
    \item potential to identify context specific needs
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Conclusion paragraph (not a real heading)}
to be written after co-author meeting.
