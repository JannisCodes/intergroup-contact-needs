# Needs in Intergroup Contact

Welcome to the GitHub Repository for the 'Migration Experience' Project.

This repository brings together the full manuscript (syncronized from Overleaf) as well as all data sets and their analysis markdown files (syncronized from a local RStudio instance in RMarkdown files).

The full annotated analysis code is available [here](https://janniscodes.github.io/intergroup-contact-needs/Supplemental-Material-B-Annotated-Analysis).

Please note that the full repository will remain 'private' until after the manuscript has been accepted for publication (to allow for blind peer review).
