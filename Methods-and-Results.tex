\section{Study 1}

Based on our main hypotheses, the aim of our first study is to
specifically test the general contact hypothesis, the influence of core
need fulfillment, and perceived interaction quality during intergroup
contacts. To this aim, we conducted an intensive longitudinal survey
study with recent economic migrants to the Netherlands, gathering a
large body of ecologically valid data on need satisfaction in real-life
intergroup contact situations.
