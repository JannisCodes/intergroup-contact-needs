%DIF -------
One challenge of modern intergroup contact research has been the question of when and why an interaction is perceived as positive and leads to better intergroup relations. We propose to consider situational psychological needs during everyday intergroup contact. We conducted three extensive longitudinal studies with recent migrants, to capture their interactions with the majority outgroup (total \textit{N} of measurements = 10,297; total \textit{N} participants = 207). The novel psychological needs mechanism is consistently a strong predictor of positive attitudes during intergroup interactions and these positive effects emerged via perceived interaction quality. The situational needs model is robust to alternative models and outperforms Allport's contact conditions. As one of the first studies to test intergroup contact theory using extensive longitudinal data, we offer insight into the mechanisms of positive intergroup contact during real-life interactions and find situational motivations to be a key building block of understanding and addressing positive intergroup interactions. %DIF >

\noindent\textbf{Public significance statement}: In this paper, we provide evidence that the fulfillment of situational psychological needs during real-life intergroup contacts meaningfully predicts perceived interaction quality and positive outgroup attitudes. Methodologically, this offers testament to the emerging practice of capturing real-life interactions using extensive longitudinal data. Theoretically, our results give weight to motivational fulfillment as a flexible and effective mechanism for understanding positive intergroup contact. %DIF >

%Conflict between social groups and their individual members remains a prevalent feature of the modern human condition. Experiences of prejudices, discrimination, and animosities with other groups continue to plague the everyday lives of many people around the world. One of the main ameliorations proposed by social psychologists has been the intergroup contact hypothesis. In its most essential interpretation, the intergroup contact hypothesis postulates that frequent and positive contact with an out-group reduces prejudice and increases favorable attitudes towards the other group \citep[e.g.,][]{Allport1954b, Hewstone1996, Pettigrew1998}. And even though over the past 70 years, a plethora of studies and interventions have shown the general effectiveness of positive intergroup contact \citep[e.g.,][]{Pettigrew2006}, relatively little research has thus far explained when and why people's everyday inter-group interactions are perceived as positive.

%DIF <  Several meta-analytic reviews found that positive intergroup contact reduces prejudice and increases positive attitudes in experimental and cross-sectional studies \citep[][]{Tropp2005, Pettigrew2006, Davies2011}, as well as in intergroup contact interventions outside the lab \citep[][]{Beelmann2014, Lemmer2015}. Past research has either focused on conditions under which interactions tend to have favorable effects \citep[e.g., Allport's optimal conditions;][]{Allport1954b, Pettigrew1969} or has investigated cognitive-affective processes during contact \citep[e.g., group salience, intimacy, attachment, or intergroup anxiety;][]{Brown2005, Marinucci2021, Tropp2021, Paolini2004}. However, neither the contact conditions nor the cognitive-affective processes are particularly well equipped to explain when and why an interaction will be perceived as positive.

And similarly, addressing a relevant need for identity continuity among refugees in Turkey bolstered resilience in the face of discrimination experiences }\citep[][]{Celebi2017}\DIFadd{. Most recently, an international cross-sectional study has applied a need-based approach to the effects of positive intergroup contact.

\DIFadd{It is thus not surprising that Dovidio and colleagues propose that: "To achieve truly constructive intergroup relations, it is important that intergroup exchanges meet the psychological needs of both majority- and minority-group members." }\citep[][p. 6]{Dovidio2017}\DIFadd{.

% Difficult to test general mechanism: Either consider too many needs (situationally relevant but not feasible) or too few (feasible but not transferable). Solution: ask for main need + rating of main need  
% MAYBE MOVE THIS TO 'The Present Research Section'
One reason why motivational considerations might have remained absent from the intergroup contact literature is that there is an overwhelming number of individual \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{needs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{motives }\DIFaddend or goals that might be relevant to a person during an intergroup interaction. Researchers considering the motivational content would, thus, either test few hyper-specific needs that might not be transferable to other intergroup contexts or they may need to assess a broad \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{range of fundamental psychological needs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and diverse range of motives. However, while the individual need content differed between the different lines of research, what unites these approaches has been a focus on fulfilling the situationally relevant needs of people --- especially when we want to understand human functioning in social realms. We propose that the different lines of research share an underlying psychological mechanism, namely the motivational experience of need fulfillment. With motivation and need fulfillment we specifically mean the psychological experience of addressing an active and relevant need during the interaction. For our purposes, we define a need as:
}

\begin{definition}[Need]\label{def:need}
\DIFadd{A tension or deficiency in the organism that elicits a (non-specific) motivational force organizing affect, cognition, and behavior to reduce this unsatisfactory situation, which is to some extent necessary for the individual’s overall well-being}\DIFaddend .
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To avoid this predicament we propose to start by using }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \begin{flushright}
\DIFadd{--- based on }\citet[][]{dweck2017, Hull1943, Lewin1938, McClelland1987, Ryan2017, Steverink2006}
\end{flushright}
\end{definition}

\DIFadd{The psychological experience of need fulfillment is, thus, distinct from the content of the need (i.e., the motive or goal). The content could, for example, include physical motives (such as safety or hygiene) but also psychosocial motives }\citep[such as acceptance or competence; e.g., see][]{pittman2007}\DIFadd{. The experience of needing is a more general process that arises when any important motive is thwarted or situationally active and relevant }\citep[][]{leander2020, lewin1926e, gollwitzer1985e}\DIFadd{. It is this perceived need and the perceived fulfillment of needs that we focus on in this article. This is not to say that considering specific motives is irrelevant to contact situations but instead we propose that the psychological experience of perceived need fulfillment is a core mechanism in understanding interaction quality perceptions, well-being, and outgroup attitudes.
}

\DIFadd{To test such a proposal, we can rely on }\DIFaddend adaptive and responsive survey designs that allow a tailored approach based on the participants\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{' }\DIFaddend inputs \citep[e.g.,][]{Tourangeau2017}. In particular, we propose to ask the participants to report their main goal during the interaction in a short open-ended question (i.e., \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{situation core need ) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{name the situationally relevant need content), }\DIFaddend and with reference to their own response\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend the participants can then indicate how much this need was fulfilled during the interaction (i.e., need fulfillment \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mechanism}\DIFaddend ). Such an adaptive approach \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{would allow us to test the fundamental psychological mechanism of whether situational psychological needs indeed predict }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{allows us to take the initial step of testing whether situational need fulfillment indeed generally predicts }\DIFaddend perceived interaction quality\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, well-being, }\DIFaddend and positive outgroup attitudes \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{independent of need content}\DIFaddend . 

\section{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Real-Life Process Data}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Intergroup Contact in Daily Life}\DIFaddend }
While we have argued that a need fulfillment mechanism is relevant to intergroup contact generally, its flexible and broad applicability might be ideally suited to address the pressing issue of understanding natural intergroup contacts outside the lab. Investigations of such \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{`}\DIFaddend real-life interactions' often suffer from the difficulty that past intergroup contact research has either focused on the mechanisms of individual interactions in artificial lab studies \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(sometimes referred to as the intergroup interaction literature) }\DIFaddend or has focused on longer-term recall self-reports of natural interactions \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \citep[e.g.,][]{Pettigrew2006}%%%
\DIFdel{. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \citep[commonly referred to as the intergroup contact literature; also see][]{Pettigrew2006}\DIFadd{. }\citet[][]{MacInnis2015} \DIFadd{have even pointed out that these two approaches tend to find conflicting effects --- where individual interactions (in the lab) have more negative effects and recall of real-world contact patterns have more positive effects for intergroup relations. We, thus, miss data following people in their diverse daily interactions and investigates the psychological mechanisms of contacts, especially as they compound over time. }\DIFaddend Even with extended intervention studies, the most fine-grained data available is usually limited to pre-post-control designs. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Such empirical practices stand}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{The lack of longitudinal real-world data}\DIFaddend , however, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{stands }\DIFaddend in stark contrast to many of the theoretical advances that have focused on the dynamic nature of intergroup relations \citep[e.g.,][]{Pettigrew1998}, as well as the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{core idea of the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{original }\DIFaddend contact hypothesis, which was focused on the daily interactions of people \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \citep[see][]{Allport1954b}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \citep[][]{Allport1954b}\DIFaddend . As a result, prominent \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{figures within the intergroup contact field have called for studies that collect longitudinal }%DIFDELCMD < \citep[][]{Pettigrew1998, Pettigrew2008, Pettigrew2008b, Pettigrew2011} %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{researchers in the field have long called for longitudinal }\citep[][]{Pettigrew1998, Pettigrew2008, Pettigrew2011} \DIFaddend and real-life experience-sampling data outside the lab \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \citep[][]{MacInnis2015, McKeown2017, Dixon2005}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \citep[][]{MacInnis2015, McKeown2017}\DIFaddend . Such data would be able to capture real-life interactions that include interaction-specific mechanism information close \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to }\DIFaddend the actual experience\footnote{Additionally, such experience-sampling data can be collected close to the intergroup interactions and would, thus, largely mitigate recall biases. Moreover, because data is nested within participants, experience-sampling data often allows \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to capture }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{capturing }\DIFaddend large amounts of high-quality data with relatively few participants \DIFaddbegin \citep[][]{shiffman2008}\DIFaddend .}.

% Used to be difficult but technological and methodological developments (e.g., FormR + HLM) → collect large body of intensive longitudinal data
In the past, such data collections were often unfeasible because they were either physically impractical or too expensive. However, recent technological developments allow us to easily collect experience sampling data on mobile devices \citep[e.g.,][]{Keil2020} or using web-based applications \citep[e.g.,][]{Arslan2020}. At the same time, analytical methods for such more complex data have become more readily available, making the analyses more approachable \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \citep[see, e.g.,][]{ODonnell2021}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \citep[e.g., see][]{ODonnell2021}\DIFaddend . Given these \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend technological and methodological developments, we were able to collect \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a large amount of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{three independent studies of extensive }\DIFaddend real-life data following the daily intergroup interactions of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{recent }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{recently arrived }\DIFaddend migrants with the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{majority group }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{majority-group }\DIFaddend members.  

\section{The Present Research}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Using three independent sets of extensive longitudinal data (Studies 1–3), the }\DIFaddend aim of this paper is essentially threefold. First, our study is among the first to test the fundamental tenets of intergroup contact and Allport's conditions in real-life extensive longitudinal data. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Second, we test whether the fulfillment situational psychological needs is meaningfully related to more positive outgroup attitudes following intergroup interactions. And third, we test the role of interaction quality in the relationship of psychological need fulfillment and outgroup attitudes. Based on this we formulated three main hypotheses:
}%DIFDELCMD < \begin{enumerate}[label=H\arabic*:]
%DIFDELCMD <     \item %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Translating the contact hypothesis into extensive longitudinal data is not a trivial task, as past research traditions have used two fundamentally different approaches. While lab studies have tended to focus on the effect of a single positive interaction, cross-section studies have primarily investigated the frequency of positive interactions more generally. Extensive longitudinal data allows us to investigate both. We can test whether having an interaction vs. not having an interaction improves intergroup relations, but we can also use the participant's 30-day contact reports to test whether participants with more positive interactions tend to benefit more from intergroup contact. Testing both approaches to the contact hypothesis allows us to go beyond a replication of the basic theory but could disentangle individual- from aggregated contact effects and would allow for a direct comparison with both bodies of literature. 
}

\DIFadd{A second key decision was our choice to focus on the minority experience during the contact. While the same mechanisms should hold for the experience of members in high-powered groups, there is substantially more research available that focuses on the experience of the majority group, and minority perspectives are historically often understudied }\citep[e.g.,][]{Dovidio2017}\DIFadd{. At the same time, however, minority groups are often underprivileged and research is direly needed to understand the more prevalent experiences of stress and health issues among minorities }\citep[e.g.,][]{alvidrez2019}\DIFadd{. 
}

\DIFadd{A third and final non-trivial aspect of translating the intergroup contact hypothesis into extensive real-world data was the choice of the outcome variable. For our main analyses, we chose outgroup attitudes --- the positive or negative evaluation of the other group. We chose outgroup attitudes mainly because they are the most common outcome considered within the intergroup contact literature }\citep[e.g.,][]{Pettigrew2006, Paolini2021}\DIFadd{. As the methodology is relatively new to the field, we sought to first replicate (and then extend) the most reliable effects of the contact hypothesis within the ESM data. Outgroup attitudes are, however, not without controversy, especially for minority group members' intergroup contact. In particular, positive outgroup attitudes have been shown to increase harmony and reduce the willingness to support social change among the disadvantaged in some cases --- even in the face of injustice }\citep[e.g.,][]{dixon2012, saguy2009}\DIFadd{. While a recent review found the effect to be less conclusive for longitudinally collected data and less consistent for positive interactions (rather than interactions generally), the backfire effect remains an important possibility for the present data }\citep[see][]{reimer2023}\DIFadd{. In order to ensure at least a direct benefit to the minority group members, we also assess the effect of the need fulfillment mechanism on well-being as the dependent variable as part of our robustness analyses below.
}

\DIFadd{With these important considerations in mind, we test the basic contact hypothesis within and across the three studies. In particular, we assess the effect of individual interactions within each study using a multilevel model, but to avoid power limitations, we test the collective effect of contact frequency and -quality after the individual studies, across all participants.
}\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5\parindent]
    \item[\DIFadd{H1:}] \DIFaddend Based on the most general understanding of the contact hypothesis, an increase in frequency and quality of contact should jointly account for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{changes in }\DIFdelend more favorable outgroup attitudes \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{within and }\DIFaddend across extensive longitudinal data.
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \item %%%
\item%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{Based on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \end{enumerate}

\DIFadd{The test of Allport's conditions is notably restricted to measurements that report on outgroup interactions because Allport's conditions and interaction quality ratings cannot meaningfully be measured or imputed if participants did not have an interaction. Focusing on the interactions in detail, we use a multi-level regression model to test whether interactions that are higher in the fulfillment of Allport's conditions predict more favorable outgroup attitudes. We would also expect that this is due to such interactions being perceived as higher in interaction quality.
}\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5\parindent]
    \item[\DIFadd{H2:}] \DIFadd{Based on the literature about }\DIFaddend Allport’s optimal contact conditions, intergroup interactions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that are higher in }\DIFaddend equal status, common goals, collaboration, and structural support should predict more favorable outgroup attitudes due to more positive interaction quality perceptions within the extensive longitudinal data.
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \item %%%
\item%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \end{enumerate}

\DIFadd{Once the general contact hypothesis is established within the ESM data, our second main aim is to test our main theoretical proposal that the fulfillment of situational psychological needs is meaningfully related to more positive outgroup attitudes following intergroup interactions. As our main proposal is concerned with the mechanisms of successful intergroup contact, we again focus on outgroup interaction reports. Within a multi-level model, we expect interactions that are higher in situational core need fulfillment to be perceived as more positive, and as a result that these interactions also predict more positive outgroup attitudes. We also expect the needs mechanism to work at least as well as Allport's conditions. We particularly expect part of Allport's contact conditions to be a static set of situational needs so that the situational core need fulfillment should explain some of the same variance in outgroup attitudes.
}\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5\parindent]
    \item[\DIFadd{H3:}] \DIFaddend Based on our proposal, intergroup interactions with higher situational core need fulfillment should predict more favorable outgroup attitudes due to more positive interaction quality perceptions within the extensive longitudinal data. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We also expect situational need fulfillments to work at least as well as Allport's optimal contact conditions in predicting outgroup attitudes.
}\DIFaddend \end{enumerate}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Beyond these main hypotheses we have formulated several sub-hypotheses that form the basis for our analysis plan (these sub-hypotheses also include several robustness checks and are available in Appendix \ref{app:AppendixHypotheses}). Given the more complex data structure of the extensive longitudinal data, we opted to test }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{Our third aim is to ensure that }\DIFaddend our \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{results are robust, stable, and ecologically valid. To test the robustness of our need-fulfillment mechanism we test whether the need mechanism is indeed specific to outgroup interactions and whether the process could be explained by a smaller set of fundamental psychological needs instead. We additionally, assess the need fulfillment mechanism in predicting individual well-being benefits and check whether different types of needs or interactions change the main results. We present the full robustness analyses in }\appref{app:AppendixRobustness}\DIFadd{. To test the stability and reliability of our results, we utilize forest plots and meta-analytic estimates for our main analyses. To assess the embeddedness of our situational core needs, we use an exploratory topic model for the participants' free-text entries and compare the extracted content topics with themes commonly found within the motivational literature.
}

\DIFadd{Before turning to individual studies, two methodological matters need consideration. Firstly, we tested most of our }\DIFaddend hypotheses using \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a multilevel regression model, where the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{multilevel regression models, where }\DIFaddend measurement occasions (level 1) were nested within \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend participants (level 2). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Given that more complex dynamic modeling procedures are not necessary to test these more basic hypotheses, we will focus on the contemporaneous effect of the data (e.g., need fulfillment during the intergroup interaction predicts outgroup attitudes following the interaction). Such an approach is also }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This approach is }\DIFaddend tolerant to missing data and uneven case numbers within participants. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdel{To test our main hypotheses, we collected three independent sets of extensive longitudinal data (Studies 1–3}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Furthermore, we use a hierarchical modeling approach and report the final model in-text }\citep[][; for the full modeling process see Supplementary Material A]{snijders2012}\DIFadd{.

\subsubsection{Participants}

After receiving ethical approval from the University \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of Groningen}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Masked for Peer
Review}\DIFaddend , we recruited 23 \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{non-Dutch }\DIFaddend migrants using the local paid
participant pool\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and
specifically targeted non-Dutch migrants to participate in our study}\DIFdelend . Participants reported on their interactions for at
least 30 days with two daily measures (capturing the morning and
afternoon). With this design, we aimed at getting 50-60 measurements per
participant (\textit{M} = 53.26, \textit{SD} = 16.72, \textit{total N} =
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1225}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1,225}\DIFaddend ). This is a common number of measurements found in experience
sampling studies and offers sufficient power to model processes within
and between participants \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \citep[e.g., for a systematic review see][]{AanhetRot2012}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \citep[e.g.,][]{AanhetRot2012}\DIFaddend . Participants
were compensated for their participation with up to 34 Euros -- each two
Euros for pre- and post-questionnaire \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as well as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend 50 Eurocents for every
experience sampling measurement\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{occasion}\DIFdelend . The sample consisted of relatively
young, educated, and western migrants from the global north (\(M_{age}\)
= 24.35, \(SD_{age}\) = 4.73, 19 women, 15 students). The sample
accurately describes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{one of }\DIFdelend the largest groups of migrants in the region
\citep[][]{GemeenteGroningen2015}.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

The study itself consisted of three main parts, an introductory
pre-measurement, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend the daily experience sampling measurements, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as well
as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend a
concluding post-measurement. After giving informed consent, participants
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{started by filling }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{filled }\DIFaddend in an online pre-questionnaire assessing demographics and general
information about their immigration. Over the next thirty days,
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the participants then }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{participants }\DIFaddend were invited twice a day (at \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{12
pm }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{12pm }\DIFaddend and 7pm) to reflect upon
their interactions, psychological need fulfillments, and current
attitudes towards the Dutch outgroup\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\textit{\DIFdel{median duration}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 2M 22S, }\textit{\DIFdel{MAD duration}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 1M 19S)}\DIFdelend . General compliance was high
(85.90\% of all invited surveys were filled
in)\footnote{Two participants completed only two days (among the others, participation was 93.70\%)\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.}\DIFaddend }.
The response rates were approximately equal during mornings (\textit{n}
= 621) and afternoons (\textit{n} = 604) and most measurements were
completed within four hours of the invitation. After the final day of
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{daily diary }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience sampling }\DIFaddend measurements, participants were invited to fill in a
longer post measurement survey that mirrored the pre-measurement. All
key variables for this study were part of the short \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{daily diary }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience sampling
}\DIFaddend surveys.

\subsubsection{Materials}

\paragraph{Intergroup Contact}

To test the prerequisite effect of intergroup contact, every experience
sampling measurement started with the question
``\textit{Did you meet a Dutch person this morning [/afternoon]? (In person interaction for at least 10 minutes)}''.
Our participants recorded between 2--51 \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{interactions with Dutch outgroup
members }\DIFaddend (3.23--91.07\% of individual \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{daily diary measurements;
31.59\% of all 1225 daily diary
responses)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience sampling measurements;
387 of all 1,225 experience sampling
responses)}\DIFaddend \footnote{Two participants only recorded two \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{daily diary }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience sampling }\DIFaddend measurements each and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{non }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{none }\DIFaddend of these included outgroup contacts. These participants are removed from any analyses \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{including }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that focus on }\DIFaddend outgroup contacts.}.

\paragraph{Psychological Needs}

Irrespective of whether participants had an interaction with Dutch
people or not, everyone answered a short series of questions on
psychological need fulfillment. However, whereas participants with
interactions reported on the need fulfillment during the interaction,
people without interactions with Dutch people judged the past daytime
period in general. To assess the fulfillment of psychological needs, we
included two types of need measurement: (1) the core situational need
and (2) general self-determination theory needs.

For the core situational need, we asked participants in an \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{open ended
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{open-ended
}\DIFaddend text field:
``\textit{What was your most important goal [during the interaction / this morning / this afternoon]?}''.
Then, with reference to the text entry, we asked how much this core need
was fulfilled during the interaction or the past daytime period:
``\textit{[The interaction / You] fulfilled your goal: [-previous text entry-]}''
on a continuous slider scale ranging from strongly disagree (-50) to
strongly agree (+50). \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{We, additionally, included a common measure of three }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend self-determination theory \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{needs }%DIFDELCMD < \citep[see][]{Downie2008}%%%
\DIFdel{.
The items were introduced either
by ``}\textit{\DIFdel{During the interaction:}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{'' or
``}\textit{\DIFdel{This morning }%DIFDELCMD < [%%%
\DIFdel{/afternoon}%DIFDELCMD < ]%%%
\DIFdel{:}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{'' and measured autonomy
(``}\textit{\DIFdel{I was myself.}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{''), competence
(``}\textit{\DIFdel{I felt competent.}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{''), and relatedness (without intergroup
contact ``}\textit{\DIFdel{I had a strong need to belong}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{''; with intergroup
contact: ``}\textit{\DIFdel{I shared information about myself.}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{'' and
``}\textit{\DIFdel{The other(s) shared information about themselves.}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{''). All
items were rated on a continuous slider scale from very little (-50) to
a great deal (+50).
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{need measurements
are described in }\appref{app:AppendixRobustness}\DIFadd{.
}\DIFaddend 

\paragraph{Perceived Interaction Quality}

As an explanatory mechanism, we assessed ratings of the perceived
interaction quality. As our main measurement, participants rated the
statement ``\textit{Overall the interaction was …}'' on two continuous
slider scales measuring pleasantness
\citep[from unpleasant (-50) to pleasant (+50)) and meaningfulness (from superficial (-50) to meaningful (+50); both items adapted from][]{Downie2008}.

\paragraph{Outgroup Attitudes}

At the end of every \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{daily diary measurement}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience sampling measurement, }\DIFaddend we asked all
participants about their current attitudes towards the Dutch -- our main
dependent variable. To assess the momentary outgroup evaluation we used
the common feeling thermometer: ``How favorable do you feel towards the
Dutch?'' \citep[][]{Lavrakas2008}. Participants then rated their
attitude on a continuous slider scale from ``very cold -- 0'' through
``no feeling -- 50'' to ``very warm -- 100''. Both the question phrasing
as well as the tick labels were consistent with large-scale panel
surveys \citep[e.g.,][]{DeBell2010}.

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Contact Hypothesis}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We tested the most general contact hypothesis in two steps. First, we
assessed whether more intergroup interactions were related to to more
positive outgroup attitudes. Second, we tested whether a potential
positive effect on outgroup attitudes depended on the interaction
quality (jointly with the number of interactions). We find that neither
the number of interactions nor the number of daily diary responses with
an interaction were significantly related with the average outgroup
attitudes (all \textbar{} }\textit{\DIFdel{r}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{\textbar{} \textless{} 0.03, all
}\textit{\DIFdel{p}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{\textgreater{} 0.887). This is to say that within our data,
participants with more outgroup interactions did not have significantly
more positive outgroup attitudes. This might be due to the aggregation
within the participants or the small sample size of between participant
data. Nonetheless, the aggregated data does not support the notion that
simply having more interactions with an outgroup results in more
positive outgroup attitudes.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{However, despite the missing relationship with the number of
interactions, we find a medium sized correlation between the
participants' Average Interaction Quality and their Average Outgroup
Attitudes. Thus within our data participants with a higher quality
outgroup interactions also held more positive attitudes towards that
group. And when considering the number of interactions and average
interaction quality jointly in a linear }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Using a multilevel }\DIFaddend regression, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{additionally find a statistically significant interaction term (}\textit{\DIFdel{b}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= -0.05,
}%DIFDELCMD < \textit{t}(17) %%%
\DIFdel{= -2.95, }\textit{\DIFdel{p}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 0.009, \(\eta_p^2\) = 0.34).
Looking at a floodlight analysis of the effect, we find that in our
sample with an increasing number of interactions the positive effect of
average interaction quality becomes weaker. However, it should be noted
that this is based on data aggregating all within participant nuances
and is only based on 21 people.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{We additionally used a multilevel regression to check whether having an interaction with an outgroup member had a situational (i.e.,
contemporaneous) effect within the participants. We find that having an
outgroup interaction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{find that having an outgroup contact
}\DIFaddend is indeed associated with significantly more positive outgroup attitudes
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{within the participants }\DIFdelend (\textit{b} = 2.48, \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \textit{t}(1200) %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textit{t}(1,200) \DIFaddend = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{4.36}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{4.37}\DIFaddend , \textit{p} \textless{}
.001, \textit{95\%CI}{[}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1.36}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1.37}\DIFaddend , 3.59{]}), even after controlling for
having an interaction with a non-Dutch (which did not relate to outgroup
attitudes independently\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; For }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{). Additionally, while multi-level regressions
are generally robust against unequal cell sizes, we correct for
inequalities by using centered predictors and reintroducing the means as
level two predictors (}\citealp{yaremych2021a}\DIFadd{; for }\DIFaddend full results see
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Online Supplementary Materials
B)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \tblref{tab:intergroupGeneralTblLong}\DIFadd{, }\fgrref{fig:ContactHypothesis}\DIFadd{,
and Online Supplementary Material
A)}\DIFaddend \footnote{Interestingly, adding random slopes to this model did not explain additional variance. This is unusual and might indicate \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend effect is very consistent across participants. However, the small number of participants, or other measurement issues provide an alternative explanation\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which is why we offer a combined data set analyses following the individual studies.}\DIFaddend }.
Thus, in our first data\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we find mixed results, where }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, we find initial evidence that }\DIFaddend outgroup contacts
show a positive effect on outgroup attitudes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the moment but these
results do not translate into average differences between participants,
keeping in mind that the between-participant analyses in the aggregated
form are based on a small sample size}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{within real-life data}\DIFaddend .

\subsubsection{Core Need}

The main proposal of our article is that the success of an outgroup
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interaction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contact }\DIFaddend might be explained by whether or not the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interaction
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contact }\DIFaddend fulfilled the
person's core situational need. This should, in turn, be due to a higher
perceived \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interaction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contact }\DIFaddend quality. We sequentially test whether the fulfillment
of the core need during an interaction is (1) related to more positive
outgroup attitudes, (2) higher perceived \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interaction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contact }\DIFaddend quality, and (3)
whether the variance explained by the core need is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assumed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{subsumed }\DIFaddend by the
perceived \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interaction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contact }\DIFaddend quality if considered jointly. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend We find that in the
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{highest }\DIFdelend multilevel models, the fulfillment of core situational needs during
outgroup contacts was associated with more positive outgroup attitudes
(random slopes model; \textit{b} = 0.17, \textit{t}(365) = 2.93,
\textit{p} = 0.004, \textit{95\%CI}{[}0.06, 0.29{]}) and also predicted
higher perceived \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interaction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contact }\DIFaddend quality (random intercept model; \textit{b} =
0.42, \textit{t}(365) = 8.07, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.32, 0.52{]}). Moreover, when we consider the
influences of core need fulfillment and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interaction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contact }\DIFaddend quality on outgroup
attitudes jointly, we find that virtually all variance is explained by
perceived \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interaction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contact }\DIFaddend quality (random slopes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mode}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{model}\DIFaddend ; \textit{b} = 0.23,
\textit{t}(364) = 4.22, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.12, 0.33{]}) and only little unique variance is
still explained by core need fulfillment (\textit{b} = 0.04,
\textit{t}(364) = 0.64, \textit{p} = 0.523, \textit{95\%CI}{[}-0.08,
0.15{]}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, also see }\fgrref[-A]{fig:MainPaths}\DIFaddend ). We thus find support for
our hypotheses and can conclude that in this data set the fulfillment of
core situational needs had a significant influence on outgroup
attitudes. Additionally, this effect is likely \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{being }\DIFdelend explained by its effect
through perceived \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interaction
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contact }\DIFaddend quality.

\DIFdel{To build further confidence in our results, we assessed two additional
models that might offer alternative explanations. First, to ensure that
the effect of core need fulfillment is specific to an actual
interaction, we compared the effect to core need fulfillement in
situations without an interaction. For this, we analyzed the generalized
situational core need fulfillment (either during an interaction or about
the daytime in general) and tested whether the effect differed during
daily diary measurements with and without outgroup contacts. We found no

\DIFdel{) but a significant interaction effect
of core need fulfillment and outgroup contact (}\textit{\DIFdel{b}} %DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdel{). Together with a significant main
effect of having an outgroup contact, this indicates that it is not key
need fulfillment in general --- but only key need fulfillment during an
outgroup contact that predicts more positive outgroup attitudes.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{In a final step, we controlled for other fundamental psychological needs
during the interaction. We focus on the three commonly considered self
determination needs: competence, autonomy, and relatedness. We find that
the core need adds significantly above a model with only the self

The aim of Study 2 is similar to Study 1, as we again test the general
contact hypothesis, the influence of core need fulfillment, and
perceived \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interaction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contact }\DIFaddend quality during intergroup contacts. However, in this
second study we collected a substantially larger sample of international
students who recently arrived in the Netherlands and also improved the
study design (e.g., \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{pop up }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pop-up }\DIFaddend explanations described later). The survey
method again offers a large body of ecologically valid data on need
satisfaction in real-life intergroup contact situations as these
students will likely interact with the Dutch majority outgroup on a
daily basis. Data \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend collected from November 19\textsuperscript{th},

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{After receiving ethical approval from the University of Groningen, we
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We }\DIFaddend recruited 113 international students using a local participant pool.
We specifically targeted non-Dutch students, who had recently arrived in
the Netherlands. Participants reported on their interactions for at
least 30 days with two daily measures (capturing the morning and
afternoon). With this design, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{aimed at getting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{again aimed at receiving }\DIFaddend 50-60
measurements per participant (\textit{M} = 43.94, \textit{SD} = 15.00,
\textit{total N} = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{4965}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{4,965}\DIFaddend ). As with the previous study\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend this should offer
sufficient power to model processes within participants and will lend
stronger weight to between-participant results. Participants were
compensated for their participation with partial course credits ---
depending on their participation. The sample consisted of relatively
young migrants, who were mostly from the global north (\(M_{age}\) =
20.24, \(SD_{age}\) = 2.12, 84 women). The sample fairly accurately
describes the local population of international students.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

The study procedure mirrored the setup of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{study one }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Study 1 }\DIFaddend and consisted of pre-,
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{daily diary-, and post-measurement}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience sampling-, and post-measurements}\DIFaddend . The participants were
invited for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{daily diary }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience sampling }\DIFaddend measurements twice a day (at \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{12 pm }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{12pm }\DIFaddend and
7pm) for 30 days\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\textit{\DIFdel{median duration}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 3M 46S, }\textit{\DIFdel{MAD duration}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 1M 54S)}\DIFdelend . General compliance was high (70.87\% of all invited
surveys were filled in). The response rates were approximately equal
during mornings (\textit{n} = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2608}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2,608}\DIFaddend ) and afternoons (\textit{n} =
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2357}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2,357}\DIFaddend ). All key variables for this study were part of the short
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{daily diary }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience sampling }\DIFaddend surveys.

\subsubsection{Materials}

\paragraph{Intergroup Contact}

To measure intergroup contacts, every experience sampling measurement
started with the question
``\textit{Did you meet a Dutch person this morning [/afternoon]? (in-person interaction for at least 10 minutes)}''.
Participants were additionally offered a pop-up explanation: ``With
in-person interaction, we mean a continued interaction with another
person (potentially in a group) that lasted at least 10 minutes. This
interaction should be offline and face-to-face. It should include some
form of verbal communication and should be uninterrupted to still count
as the same interaction. Any individual interaction can last minutes or
hours. If there were multiple interaction partners, we would like you to
focus on the person that was most important to you during the
interaction.''. The participants recorded between 1--43 interactions
with Dutch majority people (1.64--93.75\% of individual \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{daily diary
measurements; 18.83\% of all 4965 daily diary }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience
sampling measurements; 935 of all 4,965 experience sampling }\DIFaddend responses).

\paragraph{Psychological Needs}

For the core situational need, we asked participants in an \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{open ended
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{open-ended
}\DIFaddend text field:
``\textit{What was your main goal [during the interaction with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{X }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{-X- }\DIFaddend / this morning / this afternoon]?}''
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(where }\textit{\DIFadd{-X-}} \DIFadd{was dynamically replaced with the name of the
interaction partner)}\DIFaddend . Participants could additionally click on a pop-up
explanation: ``Your main goal during an interaction can vary depending
on the interaction. It could be to connect with friends, to find or
provide help, to achieve academic ambitions, work on your fitness, work
for a job, or simply to get a coffee, just as well as many \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{many }\DIFdelend other
concrete or abstract goals that are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{import }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{important }\DIFaddend to you in the moment. It
really depends on your subjective experience of the interaction.''.
Then, with reference to the text entry, we asked how much this core need
was fulfilled during the interaction or the past daytime period:
``\textit{During your interaction with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{X }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{-X- }\DIFaddend [this morning / this evening] your goal (-previous text entry-) was fulfilled.}''
on a continuous slider scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to
strongly agree (100).

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The measurement of the self determination needs was identical to study
1.

\DIFdelend \paragraph{Perceived Interaction Quality}

The ratings of the perceived \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interaction quality was identical to study
one.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contact quality were identical to Study 1.
}\DIFaddend 

\paragraph{Outgroup Attitudes}

As in Study 1, attitudes towards the Dutch majority outgroup were again
measured using the feeling thermometer.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{All survey details are also
available in Online Supplemental Materials A and B.
}\DIFdelend 

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Contact Hypothesis}

We tested the most general contact hypothesis \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in two steps. First, we assessed whether more intergroup interactions were related to to more
positive outgroup attitudes. Second, we tested whether a potential
positive effect on outgroup attitudes depended on the interaction
quality (jointly with the number of interactions). We find a significant
correlation with average outgroup attitudes for both the total number of
outgroup interactions (}\textit{\DIFdel{r}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 0.22, }\textit{\DIFdel{p}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 0.019) and the
number of measurement beeps with an interaction (}\textit{\DIFdel{r}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 0.28,
}\textit{\DIFdel{p}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 0.003). This is to say that within our data, participants
with more outgroup interactions did have significantly more positive
outgroup attitudes. This is inconsistent with the results we found in
the first study and might be due to the larger number of participants.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{However, we find no significant correlation between the participants'
Average Interaction Quality and their Average Outgroup Attitudes
(}\textit{\DIFdel{r}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 0.04, }\textit{\DIFdel{p}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 0.679). Thus, when considering the
number of interactions and average interaction quality jointly in a
linear regression, we find a main effect of intergroup contacts to
predict outgroup attitudes (}\textit{\DIFdel{b}} %DIFAUXCMD

interactions is moderated by the average contact quality. This is not

did have a meaningful effect on outgroup attitudes. This finding is not

after controlling for having an interaction with a non-Dutch person
(which did not relate to outgroup attitudes independently\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; For }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{). We again
added the participant means back into the model. We find that in this
data set participant-level outgroup contact proportions were also a
positive predictor of outgroup attitudes (}\textit{\DIFadd{b}} \DIFadd{= 26.55,

such effect (for }\DIFaddend full results see \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Online Supplementary Materials B}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \tblref{tab:intergroupGeneralTblLong}\DIFadd{,
}\fgrref{fig:ContactHypothesis}\DIFadd{, as well as Online Supplementary Material

show a positive effect on outgroup attitudes in the moment\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and on average between participants. However, we

of the perceived interaction quality during an outgroup interaction}\DIFdelend . \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We
additionally find an average between-participant effect of the relative

\subsubsection{Core Need}

We again sequentially tested \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{whether the fulfillment of the core need during an interaction was (1) related to more positive outgroup
attitudes, (2) higher perceived interaction quality, and (3) whether the
variance explained by the core need is assumed by the perceived
interaction quality if considered jointly. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the core need model as we did for Study 1.
}\DIFaddend We find that in the multilevel models, the fulfillment of core
situational needs during outgroup contacts was associated with more
positive outgroup attitudes (random slopes model; \textit{b} = 0.13,
\textit{t}(826) = 4.18, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.07, 0.19{]}) and also predicted higher perceived
interaction quality (random slopes model; \textit{b} = 0.40,
\textit{t}(826) = 6.46, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.28, 0.52{]}). Additionally, if we consider the
influences of core need fulfillment and interaction quality on outgroup
attitudes jointly, we find that virtually all variance is explained by
perceived interaction quality (random slopes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mode}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{model}\DIFaddend ; \textit{b} = 0.17,
\textit{t}(825) = 5.56, \textit{p} \textless{} .001,
\textit{95\%CI}{[}0.11, 0.23{]}) and only little unique variance is
still explained by core need fulfillment (\textit{b} = 0.03,
\textit{t}(825) = 1.47, \textit{p} = 0.141, \textit{95\%CI}{[}-0.01,
0.07{]}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; also see }\fgrref[-B]{fig:MainPaths} \DIFadd{and

consistent with the results in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{study one and
we thus}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Study 1. We, thus, }\DIFaddend find support for our
hypotheses \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and can conclude that in this
data set }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that }\DIFaddend the fulfillment of core situational needs had a
significant influence on outgroup attitudes and that this effect is
likely explained by its effect through perceived interaction quality.

the core situational need fulfillment. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We will, thus, again test the

\DIFdelend For this study\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend we specifically
recruited international medical students, because they represent a
particular group of migrants who face structural requirements to
integrate and interact with Dutch majority outgroup members on a daily
basis. As part of their educational program, the migrants are required
to take language courses and interact with patients as part of their
medical internships and medical residency. The extensive longitudinal
survey method again offers a large body of ecologically valid data on
need satisfaction in real-life intergroup contact situations. Data were
collected from November 8\textsuperscript{th}, 2019 to January
10\textsuperscript{th}, 2020. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD <

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{After receiving ethical approval from the University of Groningen, we
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We }\DIFaddend recruited 71 international medical students using \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a }\DIFdelend contacts within the
University Medical \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Department and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{School. We }\DIFaddend specifically targeted non-Dutch students,
who had recently arrived in the Netherlands. Participants reported on
their interactions for at least 30 days with two daily measures
(capturing the morning and afternoon). With this design, we aimed at
getting 50-60 measurements per participant (\textit{M} = 57.85,
\textit{SD} = 20.68, \textit{total N} = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{4107}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{4,107}\DIFaddend ). As with the previous
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{study this should offer }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{studies, this offered }\DIFaddend sufficient power to model processes within
participants\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and will lend stronger weight to between-participant
results}\DIFdelend . Participants were compensated \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for their participation with
partial course credits --- depending on their participation. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the same manner as during
Study 1. }\DIFaddend The sample consisted of relatively young migrants \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, who were mostly from the global
north }\DIFdelend (\(M_{age}\)
= 22.68, \(SD_{age}\) = 3.10, 59 women). The sample fairly accurately
describes the local population of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{international
students}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{young international medical
professionals}\DIFaddend .

\subsubsection{Procedure}

The study procedure mirrored the setup of studies one and two, in that
it consisted of pre-, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{daily diary-}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience sampling-}\DIFaddend , and post-measurement. The
participants were invited for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{daily diary }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience sampling }\DIFaddend measurements twice a
day (at \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{12 pm }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{12pm }\DIFaddend and 7pm) for 30 days\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\textit{\DIFdel{median duration}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 4M 13S,
}\textit{\DIFdel{MAD duration}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 2M 6S)}\DIFdelend . General compliance was high (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{93.30\%
filled daily diary surveys for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{85.92\%
filled in at least }\DIFaddend 31 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{days or moreNEED TO RE-CHECK THIS}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience sampling surveys or more}\DIFaddend ). The response
rates were approximately equal during mornings (\textit{n} = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2092}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2,092}\DIFaddend ) and
afternoons (\textit{n} = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2015}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2,015}\DIFaddend ). All key variables \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in }\DIFdelend for this study were
part of the short \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{daily diary }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience sampling }\DIFaddend surveys.

\subsubsection{Materials}

\paragraph{Intergroup Contact}

The measurement of intergroup contacts was identical to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{study two. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Study 2. }\DIFaddend The
participants recorded between 1--71 interactions with Dutch outgroup
members (2.13--87.18\% of individual \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{daily diary measurements;
41.44\%
of all 4107 daily diary }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience sampling measurements;
1,702 of all 4,107 experience sampling }\DIFaddend responses).

\paragraph{Psychological Needs}

The measurement of the core situational need and its fulfillment was
identical to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{study two. Similarly, the measurement of the self
determination needs was identical to studies one and two.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Study 2.
}\DIFaddend 

\paragraph{Allport's Conditions}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To measure }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We measured }\DIFaddend how much each of the interactions fulfilled Allport's
conditions of optimal contact \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{using a common short scale comprised of
four attributes }\citep{Islam1993, Voci2003, AlRamiah2012a}\DIFadd{. In
particular, }\DIFaddend we asked participants to rate how much the interaction had
equal status
(``\textit{The interaction with [name interaction partner] was on equal footing (same status)}''),
a common goal
(``\textit{[name interaction partner] shared your goal ([free-text entry interaction key need])}''),
support of authorities
(``\textit{The interaction with [name interaction partner] was voluntary}''),
and intergroup cooperation
(``\textit{The interaction with [name interaction partner] was cooperative}'').
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We create a mean-averaged index of Allport's conditions in response to
past findings indicating that the conditions are best conceptualized
jointly and as functioning together rather than as fully independent
factors }\citep[][, p. 766]{Pettigrew2006}\DIFadd{. For full psychometric
information see Online Supplementary Material A.
}\DIFaddend 

\paragraph{Perceived Interaction Quality}

The ratings of the perceived interaction quality \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was identical to study
one.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were identical to Study
1.
}\DIFaddend 

\paragraph{Outgroup Attitudes}

Attitudes towards the Dutch majority outgroup \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend again measured using
the feeling thermometer, as in studies one and two.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{All survey details
are also available in Online Supplemental Materials A and B.
}\DIFdelend 

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Contact Hypothesis}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We tested the most general contact hypothesis in two steps. First, we
assessed whether more intergroup interactions were related to to more
positive outgroup attitudes. Second, we tested whether a potential
positive effect on outgroup attitudes depended on the interaction
quality (jointly with the number of interactions). We find no
significant correlation between intergroup contact and average outgroup
attitudes --- for neither the total number of outgroup interactions
(}\textit{\DIFdel{r}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 0.01, }\textit{\DIFdel{p}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 0.946) and the number of measurement
beeps with an interaction (}\textit{\DIFdel{r}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 0.13, }\textit{\DIFdel{p}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 0.291). This
is to say that within our data, participants with more outgroup
interactions did not have significantly more positive or negative
outgroup attitudes. This is again consistent with the results we found
in the first study but inconsitent with the significant relationship we
find in the second study.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{However, we do find a significant correlation between the participants'
Average Interaction Quality and their Average Outgroup Attitudes
(}\textit{\DIFdel{r}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 0.25, }\textit{\DIFdel{p}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 0.036). Thus, when considering the
number of interactions and average interaction quality jointly in a
linear }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In a multilevel }\DIFaddend regression, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{only find a main effect of average perceived
interaction quality on predict outgroup attitudes (}\textit{\DIFdel{b}} %DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdel{= 2.22, }\textit{\DIFdel{p}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{= 0.030, \(\eta_p^2\) = 0.07). Given
the missing aggregate relationship between number of interactions and
outgroup attitudes, we find no significant effect of interactions
themselves nor do we find a significant interaction effect. This result
mirrors that of study one but is inconsistent with the second study. But
again this inconsistency is not necessarily surprising given that the
variables aggregate all within person variation and there were
substantially more measurements where participants did not have an

that followed an outgroup contact.

interaction with a non-Dutch (which did not relate to outgroup attitudes

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Online
Supplementary Materials B}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \tblref{tab:intergroupGeneralTblLong} \DIFadd{and
}\fgrref{fig:ContactHypothesis}\DIFaddend ). Thus, in our third \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{dataset we find
some
mixed results, outgroup contacts are not significantly related to
outgroup attitudes on aggregate between participants and this effect is
also not suppressed by a average interaction quality (i.e., no
interaction effect). However, while the aggregate data is partly
inconsistent with the first two studies, the within person contemoranous

that the within-person contemporaneous }\DIFaddend effect of intergroup contact \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was

To \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{compare the models using either }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{test whether }\DIFaddend Allport's conditions or the core need fulfillment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to predict }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were

model performance indices (i.e., Akaike information criterion, and
Bayesian information criterion), and then consider the two predictors in
a joint model to see whether the two approaches \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{predict }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{predicted }\DIFaddend the same
variance in outgroup attitudes. When comparing the model selection
indices\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we find }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, we found }\DIFaddend that the fulfillment of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{situation core need

\(AIC_{Allport}\), and \(BIC_{CoreNeed}\) 12664.55 \textless{} 12684.12

jointly, we find that both significantly predict outgroup attitudes with
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{similar sized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{similar-sized }\DIFaddend regression parameters (random slopes model; Allport's
Conditions: \textit{b} = 0.16, \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \textit{t}(1600) %%%

Allport's conditions and the core need fulfillment seem to (in part)
work through perceived interaction quality, they explain different
aspects of the variance in outgroup attitudes and do not constitute one
another.

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \section{\DIFadd{Stability, Robustness, and Embeddedness across Studies}}
\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We again checked }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Beyond the individual results of the three studies, we conducted a
number additional analyses to test the broader cross-study claims,
account }\DIFaddend for alternative models\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to the core need fulfillment.
First, when considering generalized situational core need fulfillment

there is no significant main }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and contextualize our results. Jointly,
these stability, robustness, and embeddedness analyses seek to
strengthen our confidence in the results.
}

\subsection{\DIFadd{Stability}}

\DIFadd{We ran two analyses that tested the stability of our results. We first
assess the consistency of the results reported in the three studies and
use a meta-analytic approach to gauge the general effect sizes. The
second stability analysis we conduct seeks to asses the extend to which
the within person contemporaneous effects extend to an aggregated
version that mirrors the many cross-sectional recall studies.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Consistency}}

\DIFadd{We first assessed the stability of our main analyses across the three
studies. Plotting the effect sizes of each parameter of interest in a
forest plot, as well as the average meta-analytic effect, shows that for
the basic contact hypothesis test outgroup contact had a strong and
consistent effect on outgroup attitudes. Interactions with non-outgroup
members consistently had no meaningful effect on outgroup attitudes
(}\fgrref{fig:ContactHypothesis}\DIFadd{). While this would be expected from the
general intergroup contact literature, this is not a trivial finding.
Being among the first to assess the contact hypothesis using real-life
intensive longitudinal data, we extend cross-sectional findings to
individual-level assessments. When looking at the fulfillment of core
needs during intergroup contacts, we find that the motivational
mechanism is consistently a meaningful predictor of interaction quality
perceptions and outgroup attitudes (see
}\fgrref[ A and B]{fig:AllportNeedFulfillment}\DIFadd{). We also see that the
}\DIFaddend effect of core need fulfillment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(random
slopes model ; }\textit{\DIFdel{b}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on outgroup attitudes is strongly
reduced when modeled together with interaction quality perceptions,
supporting our assertion that interaction quality offers a psychological
mechanism for the direct effect (see
}\fgrref[-C]{fig:AllportNeedFulfillment}\DIFadd{).
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Aggregated Analysis}}

\DIFadd{A second stability test is checking whether the within person effects
translate to a broader aggregated between subjects effect, which would
mirror common cross-sectional practices. During the main analyses, we
have thus far shown that participants held more positive outgroup
attitudes following intergroup contacts and that perceived interaction
quality was associated with more positive outgroup attitudes following
an intergroup contact. We have, however, not brought the two elements of
the contact hypothesis together in a single analysis. To jointly test
the effects of contact frequency and average interaction quality, we ran
a linear regression model where average outgroup attitudes were
predicted by the number of interactions and the average interaction
quality ratings of all participants across the three studies. We did so
while controlling for the possible effects of study-specific
differences. To include the study-membership as a control variable, we
used the student sample (Study 2) as the reference group because it was
both the largest and the most homogeneous study. Looking at the overall
model, we found that the model predicted 13.89\% of the variance in
average outgroup attitudes (}\textit{F}(9, 189) \DIFaddend = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.03, }%DIFDELCMD < \textit{t}(3835) %%%

\DIFdel{)but a stronger interaction
effect of core need fulfillment and outgroup contact }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{= 0.14). Looking at the individual
effects, we found that only the number of outgroup interactions has a

0.93}\DIFaddend {]}). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Together with a significant main
effect of having an outgroup contact }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The average interaction quality perceptions had a much smaller
effect }\DIFaddend (\textit{b} = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{5.41, }%DIFDELCMD < \textit{t}(3835) %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.29, }\textit{t}(189) \DIFaddend = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{6.36}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2.09}\DIFaddend , \textit{p} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\textless{} .001}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{= 0.038}\DIFaddend ,

interaction effect at all. In short, the effect of interaction frequency
did not depend on the average interaction quality.
}

\subsection{\DIFadd{Robustness}}

\DIFadd{To check for spurious relationships, we test three additional models.
These three models assess whether the effect is indeed specific to
intergroup contact, whether the need fulfillment effect is a affected by
whether the contact was planned or accidental, and whether the
motivational mechanism also holds direct well-being benefits for the
minority members. We describe the full methods and results for the
robustness analyses in }\appref{app:AppendixRobustness}\DIFadd{. We use a
two-staged analysis approach for the robustness analyses. We first test
the model `globally' }\DIFaddend --- \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{but key need fulfillment during an outgroup
contact that predicts more positive outgroup attitudes . This finding is consistent with the results of
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{across the three studies --- in a three level
multilevel regression (i.e., measurements nested within participants,
and participants nested within studies). Only in a second step do check
for study-specific idiosyncrasies.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Contact specific}}

\DIFadd{To ensure that the core need fulfillment is outgroup contact specific,
we return to the full sample of intensive longitudinal measurements and
test whether there is an interaction effect of outgroup contact (vs.~no
outgroup contact) and core need fulfillment. We expected that the effect
of core need fulfillment on outgroup attitudes is specific to outgroup
interactions and not merely due to a more need-fulfilled life in
general. Both in the global test, as well as in the individual studies,
we consistently find a significant and meaningful interaction effect of
outgroup interaction and key need fulfillment, indicating that key need
fulfillment is specifically a powerful predictor of outgroup attitudes
during intergroup contacts. When assessing the individual studies
independently, we additionally find a strong main effect of contact as
well as a smaller main effect of key need fulfillment, qualifying the
contact-specific relationship (see }\appref{app:AppendixRobustness} \DIFadd{for
full results). In sum, we thus find that at the effect of key need
fulfillment on outgroup attitudes is particularly important for outgroup
interactions (rather than only need fulfillment in general).
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Interaction intend}}

\DIFadd{To test whether }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{previous studies
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{need mechanism was affected by whether the
interaction was accidental or planned we ran an exploratory moderation
analysis using the participants' ratings of how much they perceived the
interaction as `accidental'. It should be noted that, in order to keep
the ESM surveys short, we asked our participants to focus on most the
important interaction (i.e.,
``}\textit{\DIFadd{The following questions will be about the interaction }\underline{\DIFadd{you consider most significant}}\DIFadd{.}}\DIFadd{'';
emphasis as in original). This was also reflected in a relatively low
average and consistent right skew of the `accidental' item. Nonetheless,
there remained a substantial variance in the item and we continued with
the moderation analysis. We found that both in the overall test as in
all studies individually key need fulfillment remained a strong
predictor of outgroup attitudes, even when accounting for differences in
whether the interaction was accidental (rather than planned). Moreover,
in none of the analysis did we see a moderation effect of interaction
intend nor did we find a main effect of interaction intend. There is,
thus, consistent evidence that the need fulfillment mechanism was not
meaningfully different for more accidental interactions.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Well-being outcome}}

\DIFadd{Given the well-established criticism that more positive outgroup
attitudes might not always be beneficial for minority group members
}\citep[e.g.,][]{reimer2023}\DIFadd{, we conducted an additional exploratory
analysis assessing the effect of need fulfilling outgroup interactions
on reported well-being. Experienced well-being is a common indicator of
health and an important life quality measurement in itself, especially
for migrants or other minority groups }\citep[e.g.,][]{bhugra2011}\DIFadd{. We
find that the results with well-being as the outcome variable mirror our
main results in effect size and interpretation. The results are
consistent across and within studies and, thus, add weight to the
importance of considering the need fulfillment experiences when it comes
to outgroup interactions.
}

\subsection{\DIFadd{Embeddedness}}

\DIFadd{To embed our results further, we also considered the content and types
of needs that participants reported during the study. For these
embeddedness analyses, we first assessed the self-reported motives of
the participants and then also control the commonly considered
self-determination theory needs}\DIFaddend .
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{In a final step we again checked whether during the interaction the core

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Contact need content}}

\DIFadd{We used the qualitative data from the participants' self-identified core
needs to contextualize the results of our main analysis. However,
because our participants jointly reported on thousands of intergroup
contacts, it would not have been feasible to analyze these qualitative
responses in a traditional qualitative content analysis. We instead
relied on recent machine learning advances within the natural language
processing domain. For our analysis, we used the BERT language model.
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) was
developed by Google in 2018 and today forms a key element of many
natural language processing workflows. In its essence, BERT is a
framework that allows users to codify every word in relation to every
other word within a large set of documents. We extracted 47 topics from
the 2}\DIFaddend ,\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the core need fulfillment flexibly takes on some of the
explained variance of all of the three fundamental needs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{983 interaction goal free-text entries (after duplicate removal)
--- a relatively large number of topics. The higher number of topics
allowed us to retain more of the smaller topics and leaves a relatively
low number of 308 free-text entries unclassified (10.33\%). A full
write-up of the topic modeling process is available in Online
Supplemental Material C.
}

\DIFadd{In terms of the content of the topics, we find that a number of topics
are primarily task-oriented, where participants hope to increase their
study, research, presentation, or work performance. Opposing the task-
and work-oriented needs, are a wide variety of leisure-related needs
wishes, like relaxation and entertainment. Additionally, some clusters
were primarily relationship-oriented, so that participants sought
contact with outgroup members for intimate and casual social contact in
itself. Similarly, socializing and celebrations were also explicit
social needs (incl., parties). This also included a subtopic of
spiritual, religious, and otherwise transcendental needs
(incl.~meditation, prayer, religious services). Among the
leisure-oriented topics was also a set of contact goals that were
specifically migration-specific (e.g., wish to learn about culture,
politics, and language) or were concerned with informational needs more
generally (e.g., seeking answers, bureaucratic information). A similar
set of topics was specifically geared towards a wish to experience
cultural products (e.g., music, theater, food) or had travel-related
goals in their interactions with the majority group members. In sum,
almost all extracted topics fall into broader or narrower need concepts
that are commonly discussed within the need fulfillment literature

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{To ensure that our results are not impacted by differences in the
reported goals and motives, we additionally coded the topics we
extracted during the topic modeling on two dimensions of how much they
reflect a practical and a psychological goal-directedness. We chose
practical and psychological needs specifically as our dimensions to
account for differences in the types of needs that participants commonly
reported. With practical motives we refer to specific, tangible goals or
tasks that participants aimed to accomplish during the interaction.
These instrumental goals are usually observable, concrete, and often
centered on external outcomes, such as acquiring resources, completing
tasks, and addressing immediate challenges }\citep[e.g.,][]{oduntan2019}\DIFadd{.
With psychological motives we refer to underlying motives or desires
that are more abstract and relate to personal fulfillment and
well-being. In contrast to practical needs, psychological needs delve
into the subjective and internal aspects of human experiences. These
needs pertain to emotions, social connections, and cognitive processes,
reflecting individuals' quest for personal growth, well-being, and
thriving in social relationships }\citep[e.g.,][]{dweck2017}\DIFadd{. Note that
with this approach any particular motive can include a practical and/or
a psychological goal-directedness but can also be classified as not
having any goal at all. We found high inter-rater reliability for the
two independent coders, who coded all 47 topics. The codings revealed
considerable variance, which allowed us to add the two dimensions back
to each of the reported interaction motives and assess the effects of
the goal-directed character.

predictor of outgroup attitudes, when controlling for practical and

the need fulfillment itself. This result underscores the importance of
the experience of perceived need fulfillment (i.e., the perception that
one got what one needed), rather than the type of need or the content of

our situation core need fulfillment measurement to the three
self-determination theory needs (autonomy, relatedness, competence).
Within the overall model we found that across the studies core need
fulfillment remained a strong predictor of outgroup attitudes, even
after controlling for the three self-determination theory need.
Additionally, within this overall analysis, none of the
self-determination theory needs independently predicted outgroup
attitudes to a statistically significant extent (despite similar effect
sizes of relatedness). When looking at the individual studies, we again
saw that core need fulfillment remained a consistent predictor of
outgroup attitudes. However, across all three studies the fulfillment of
relatedness motives also emerged as a consistent predictor of outgroup
attitudes. Additionally, in the larger studies 2 and 3 competence
fulfillment was also related to more positive outgroup attitudes. None
of the autonomy fulfillment effects reached statistical significance. In
short, find that across our samples, relatedness fulfillment (and to a
smaller extend competence fulfillment) are instrumental in understanding
when an outgroup contact leads to more positive outgroup attitudes.
Importantly, even when considering these effects situational core need
fulfillment remains a strong and consistent predictor of outgroup
attitudes.

% Contact hypothesis in ESM data [inconsistent in aggregate but consistent in ML analysis]
When considering the results of the three studies jointly, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{find }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{found }\DIFaddend mixed results for the basic intergroup contact hypothesis. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The aggregated number of outgroup interactions across all measurements only had a significant effect on average outgroup attitudes in one of the three studies and in that study there was no significant effect of average interaction quality on outgroup attitudes (which was significant for the other two studies) . This meant that only for our smallest study did we find the expected interaction between interaction frequency and interaction quality when looking at the aggregated data across all measurements. However, once we considered }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{To replicate the two common approaches to the contact hypothesis, we looked at both the within-person effects of individual outgroup interactions (mimicking the analysis of lab studies) as well as the joint effect of interaction frequency and average interaction quality between participants (mimicking the cross-section literature). For }\DIFaddend the effect of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{having an interaction with an outgroup member }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{individual interactions, we find that having an outgroup interaction }\DIFaddend (vs. not having an \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{outgroup interaction) within the participants}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{interaction) was associated with more favorable outgroup attitudes. Similarly}\DIFaddend , we find that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{intergroup contact is a strong predictor of outgroup attitudes across all three studies (even when taking other non-outgroup interactionsinto account). While this later results is in line with our expectations, the earlier aggregate findings are surprising because most past cross-sectional studies that have investigated the effect of interaction frequency have also considered an aggregate measurement (albeit not one from actual daily reports). Even though this inconsistency with past research might be a data artefact (e.g., because most people reported more substantially mode measurements during which they did not have an outgroup interaction), }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{within outgroup interactions, }\DIFaddend the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{interaction quality was meaningfully associated with more favorable outgroup attitudes. Yet, considering interaction frequency and average interaction quality jointly was only possible on the aggregated between-participant level. Surprisingly, here we found independent effects of interaction frequency and average interaction quality ratings but no interaction effect. The }\DIFaddend absence of this aggregate effect could underline the fact that cross-sectional retrospective data might \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{suffer }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{be misleading because (1) it presents a mixture of within and between-subjects effects }\citep[][]{Hamaker2020}\DIFadd{, or (2) suffers }\DIFaddend from recall biases (e.g., where times with no outgroup interactions are undervalued by participants during the retrospective evaluations). 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In summary, we thus find that when we aggregate interaction frequencies and interaction quality from our intensive longitudinal datawe find inconsistent results from the past literature but within participants intergroup contacts are significantly related with positive outgroup attitudes}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{Interestingly, this effect is also inconsistent with the observations and theorizing of }\citet[][]{MacInnis2015}\DIFadd{, who observed that individual interactions showed negative effects on intergroup relations and the aggregate of past intergroup contacts showed positive effects on intergroup relations. There are, however, two important differences in our data compared to the past literature assessed by }\citeauthor{MacInnis2015}\DIFadd{. Firstly, what }\citeauthor{MacInnis2015} \DIFadd{called the intergroup interaction literature, has particularly focused on artificial lab studies where study participants meet a stranger from the outgroup. In our real-world data, such synthetic and controlled interactions are arguably less relevant. Secondly, what }\citeauthor{MacInnis2015} \DIFadd{called the intergroup contact literature, has looked at long-term recall self-reports --- where participants are asked to recall the quantity and average quality of intergroup contacts over the past month or year }\citep{MacInnis2015}\DIFadd{. The mental aggregation of such long-term recall surveys is substantially different from the aggregation we did based on the close-to-event reports }\citep[][]{shiffman2008}\DIFadd{. To truly compare our results to }\citet[][]{MacInnis2015} \DIFadd{theorizing, future studies should, thus, also collect a long-term recall report that mirrors the questions asked during intergroup contact studies.
}

\DIFadd{It should, however, be noted that the inconsistencies with past research might in part be a data artifact (e.g., because most people reported substantially more measurements during which they did not have an outgroup interaction). There is also a possibility that statistical power was a concern given our sample was relatively small with 207 participants and the effect of interest is an amplification interaction effect. However, if we assume an effect size of }\textit{\DIFadd{r}} \DIFadd{= -.21 for the effect of positive intergroup contacts }\citep[see][]{Pettigrew2006} \DIFadd{our sample size should approach the threshold of 80\% power at a .05 alpha level (sensitivity analysis in G*Power: $f^2 = 0.04$) --- especially if we consider the higher quality data we get from aggregating many real-world reports with less recall bias}\DIFaddend . 

% Allport's conditions in ESM data [consistent predictor and partially through quality]
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Using }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Next, using }\DIFaddend the data from our third study, we find that Allport's conditions are related to higher interaction quality perceptions and more positive outgroup attitudes. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{And when }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{When }\DIFaddend we consider interaction quality and Allport's conditions jointly, we find \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{further evidence that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that interaction quality ratings assumed a larger }\DIFaddend part of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{benefits of Allport's conditions are due to the case that such interactions are also perceived as more positive}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{shared variance in outgroup attitudes}\DIFaddend . We thus find first evidence that Allport's conditions of optimal contact are also relevant to the daily interactions recent migrants have in their interactions with majority group members. 

% Need fulfillment in intergroup contact [consistent predictor, through quality, slightly better than Allport and SDT]
Finally, when looking at the results \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for our main proposal }\DIFdelend regarding the importance of situational key needs, we find \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{highly consistent positive results across all three studies. We find }\DIFdelend that in all three extensive longitudinal \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{datasets}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data sets}\DIFaddend , the fulfillment of core needs during intergroup contacts predicts higher interaction quality perceptions\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend more positive outgroup attitudes\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, as well as higher well-being}\DIFaddend . We find that in all three studies the effect of core need fulfillment on outgroup attitudes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend either fully or partially \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{through its effect on quality perceptions, and we }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assumed by the effect of interaction quality (when considering partial regression coefficients in a joint model). We also }\DIFaddend find that need fulfillment is an important predictor even when taking other fundamental psychological needs or Allport's conditions into account. In fact\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we find that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend our core situational needs measure predicted outgroup attitudes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{slightly better than }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at least as good as }\DIFaddend Allport's conditions and consistently explained more variance \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in outgroup attitudes than any of the other }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{than commonly measured }\DIFaddend psychological needs. In most cases\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend the core need even took over the variances previously explained by the self-determination theory needs \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(see }\appref{app:AppendixRobustness}\DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend . We thus find strong evidence that within everyday life interactions of recent migrants with majority \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{group }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{outgroup }\DIFaddend members, the perception that one's \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interaction specific psychological }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{interaction-specific }\DIFaddend needs are fulfilled offers a meaningful and flexible predictor of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{outgroup attitudes. As such the data offers a first test of the motivational basis of intergroup contact.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{While we believe that a need fulfillment mechanism should be relevant to any inter-group contact, our samples focused on a minority- and (voluntary) migrant perspective. Without additional evidence it thus remains difficult to judge whether motivational effects will generalize to other migrant groups (e.g., forced migrants), other intergroup contexts (e.g., gender-, religious-, or sexual orientation groups), or to majority groups and their outgroup attitudes. We sought to replicate our results in three studies with different types of migrants but the fact remains that all three studies had slightly more women than men participating and were younger and more educated samples overall. While the samples were representative of the migrant group to the focus region, the generalizability of the sample is restricted by its characteristics. We know of no research suggesting that in other contexts need fulfillment would be less relevant but future research may extend our findings to build an even broader understanding of need fulfillment in intergroup contacts. Researchers may even seek to explore the role of need fulfillment in real-world interactions more broadly }\citep[also see][]{Downie2008}\DIFadd{.
}

\DIFadd{A second limitation lies in our methodology. While extensive longitudinal data is close to real-life events, this method }\DIFaddend comes at the expense of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{having short/singleitem operationalizations

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{longer and more robust scales. Long and repetitive scales are often not feasible in extensive longitudinal methods because of the increased burden to the participants. To circumvent this shortcoming, we have ensured that the measures we used were, whenever possible, based on past validations. However, the circumstance remains that extensive longitudinal data often does not allow the same scrutiny of measurement reliability as single–shot cross-sectional data sets. An additional methodological question lies in the unexplored potential of the longitudinal aspects of our data. For our research questions, we have focused on contemporaneous effects within the data set, yet future investigations should seek to extend the mechanism to developmental trajectories within and between participants.

As we have focused on outgroup attitudes to ensure comparability to the past literature of the contact hypothesis and to replicate the most reliable patterns within ESM data }\citep[][]{Pettigrew2006}\DIFadd{. However, especially for disadvantaged minority members positive outgroup attitudes may entail negative downstream consequences such as a reduced endorsement of social change --- even in the face of injustice }\citep[e.g.,][]{dixon2012}\DIFadd{. We have additionally tested our need-fulfillment mechanism for well-being reporst to test direct benefits of the mechanism to lived realities. However, we are among the first to collect intensive longitudinal data on the experience of minority migrants and it remains an open empirical question whether the more positive outgroup attitudes following need-fulfilling interactions might ironically exacerbate inequalities for the disadvantaged group. 
}

\DIFadd{Finally, our conceptualization of core situational needs has been focused on the most essential test of a motivational mechanism. This comes at the expense of specificity in the situational motives (i.e., we have not explored whether different types of needs have stronger effects on interaction quality and outgroup attitudes). Such an investigation would be possible with the adaptive measurement we used (e.g., by clustering or classifying the free text entries) but would not have been relevant to our theory–focused research question. Nonetheless, future research may explore which exact needs are most important in different intergroup contexts. 
}

\subsection{\DIFadd{Implications}}
%DIF >  ESM data
\DIFadd{Despite these limitations, we can nonetheless draw a number of implications for other researchers and practitioners --- ranging from the benefits of longitudinal data to theoretical implications. A first implication concerns the feasibility and usefulness of extensive longitudinal data for intergroup contact research and the broader field of social psychology. While setting up an extensive longitudinal study is not easy, we believe the efforts to be similar to a sizable cross-sectional data collection (i.e., for a longitudinal or a high-quality cross-sectional data set with roughly 3,000 intergroup interactions captured and over 10,000 data points in total). Intensive longitudinal data, thus, opens up the possibility to explore research questions that focus on real-life phenomena outside the lab or focus on phenomena that depend on changes and influences over time. In the context of intergroup contact research, we are among the first to answer calls to test intergroup contact mechanisms using extended real-life }\DIFaddend data \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on intergroup contact using ESM method (do we have a formR ref in there?; set up is feasible but not the easiest; maybe even advertise the reusability of the formR survey?)

\DIFdel{role of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \citep[e.g.,][]{Pettigrew2011, MacInnis2015}\DIFadd{. In doing so, we not only collected an unprecedented amount of real-life data, but our consideration of extensive longitudinal data may present new inconsistencies in how participants perceive and cognitively aggregate their past interactions with other groups — which may suggest large-scale recall biases or conflations of within and between participant effects in conventional cross-section studies.
}

%DIF >  Motivation and core needs

\DIFdel{potential to identify context specific needs
}%DIFDELCMD < \end{enumerate}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contacts. Our results offer a first promising test of psychological needs in intergroup contact. While our results are tentative given their novelty within the field, they were highly consistent across studies and may offer new theoretical avenues. Psychological needs are a facet of the human experience that has thus far been underemphasized in the intergroup contact literature. This stands in stark contrast of the many cognitive }\citep[e.g.,][]{Pettigrew1998, Brown2005} \DIFadd{and emotional aspects investigated within the field }\citep[e.g.,][]{Stephan2008}\DIFadd{. Future research may, therefore, be able to integrate broader theoretical frameworks of intergroup contact (e.g., motivations guiding cognition and affect, which in turn drive behavior. cf., theory of reasoned goal pursuit; }\citealp{Ajzen2019}\DIFadd{. Also see }\citealp{Kreienkamp2022d}\DIFadd{). 
}\DIFaddend 

%DIF >  practical use of needs
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Additionally, situational motivations in intergroup contact also offer promising avenues for practitioners and policy-makers. Intergroup contact theory is among the most implemented psychological theories }\citep[e.g.,][]{Pettigrew2006, AlRamiah2012a, Reimer2021}\DIFadd{. Given our findings that psychological needs in everyday intergroup contacts were at least as powerful as Allport's conditions in predicting outgroup attitudes, considerations of people's needs offer a substantially more immediate mechanism to address. In cases where some or all optimal contact conditions are not possible to be fulfilled, needs offer an even more compelling alternative (e.g., where equal status is contextually not possible or in cases where people help despite a lack of institutional support). Additionally, our conceptualization of situational needs offers a clear opportunity for practitioners and interventions. Instead of addressing needs as a one-size fits all solution (e.g., simply focusing on competence needs), one may at times ask outgroup interaction partners what they need during an interaction. This is not to say that we should not explore which needs tend to be relevant to specific groups in specific intergroup contact contexts. Rather, during interventions for which data on important need contents are not available or infeasible to collect, a flexible and reactive approach of inquiring momentary intergroup contact needs might be more fruitful.

\DIFadd{In sum, we used extensive longitudinal methodologies to capture real-life interactions of recent migrants with the majority outgroup. Our three studies showcase the feasibility and utility of such data to test intergroup contact theory. We provide evidence that the fulfillment of situational psychological needs during real-life intergroup contacts meaningfully predicts perceived interaction quality and positive outgroup attitudes. Our results point to motivational needs as an understudied aspect of intergroup contact that is important in understanding when and why an interaction is perceived as positive and will lead to more positive outgroup attitudes.

\subsection{\DIFadd{1. Contact hypothesis in extensive longitudinal data.}} 
\DIFadd{Within the individual studies, we begin by testing the most basic assumption of the intergroup contact hypothesis that outgroup attitudes should be more positive after outgroup interactions but not after non-outgroup interactions. For this we use multi-level regression analyses, predicting outgroup attitudes from outgroup interaction and non-outgroup interaction dummy variables. We also include the participant means as level two predictors to fully disentangle within- (level 1) and between-participant (level 2) effects of intergroup contact }\citep[e.g.,][Section 4.6]{Snijders2012}\DIFaddend .

%DIF >  We then seek to investigate intergroup contacts and perceived interaction quality jointly. Notably, however, participants are only able to report their interaction quality perceptions if they had an interaction. This is considered to be structurally missing data and cannot meaningfully be imputed for modeling. To deal with this issue, we mimic the procedure commonly used within the cross-section literature. In particular, we conduct a person-level linear regression by aggregating the number of outgroup interactions participants had, their average interaction quality perceptions, as well as their average outgroup attitudes \citep[for possible alternative approaches see,][]{Enders2011}. To avoid an underpowered analysis, we use the aggregated data from all three studies.

To do so, we conduct a linear regression using person-level aggregated data from all three studies. In particular, we aggregate the number of outgroup interactions participants had, their average interaction quality perceptions, as well as their average outgroup attitudes. This approach has three main benefits: (1) Interaction quality ratings are only available if participants had an interaction, and the aggregation deals with this structural missingness. (2) Using the participant-level data from all three studies, we avoid potential power issues. (3) This analysis mimics the analyses conducted within the cross-section literature, where participants are asked to recall how many interactions they had over a one-month period, how positive these interactions were, and what their general attitudes towards the outgroup are.

\DIFadd{The main proposal of this manuscript has been the assertion that the fulfillment of situation core needs during an interaction will be associated with more positive interaction quality perceptions and, ultimately, more positive outgroup attitudes.

\section{\DIFadd{Robustness Analyses}}
\label{app:AppendixRobustness}

\DIFadd{In this appendix, we present the empirical details of our additional robustness analyses. These analyses are specifically designed to check for alternative models and contextualize our results. We (1) check whether core need fulfillment is indeed outgroup contact specific. For this analysis, we return to the full sample of intensive longitudinal measurements and test whether there is an interaction effect of outgroup contact (vs. no outgroup contact) and core need fulfillment. We expect that the effect of core need fulfillment is specific to outgroup interactions and not merely due to a more need-fulfilled life in general. We then check (2) whether the need mechanism is relevant to both planned and accidental outgroup interactions, and (3) extends to the more individual-focused experience of well-being. In a final set of analyses, we (4) check whether the need fulfillment mechanism is relevant to different types of need content (i.e., motives) and (5) remains relevant even when accounting for the fulfillment of }\DIFaddend fundamental psychological needs \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{into account.
Thus, the effect of key need fulfillmenton outgroup attitudes should remain strong even after controlling for autonomy

is available in Online Supplementary Material A. Correlations and
descriptive statistics of the included variables are available in
}\tblref{tab:descrFullWide} \DIFadd{and }\tblref{tab:descrOutWide}\DIFadd{.

\subsection{\DIFadd{Additional Materials}}

\DIFadd{In addition to the measurement of whether or not participants had an
intergroup interaction and their situational core need fulfillment, we
also included a number of variables that allowed us to assess the
robustness of our results.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Specific Psychological Needs}}

\DIFadd{In addition to the intergroup contact dummy and situational core need
reported in the main text, we included a common measure of three
self-determination theory needs }\citep[see][]{Downie2008}\DIFadd{. The
measurement was identical in all three studies. The items were
introduced either by ``}\textit{\DIFadd{During the interaction:}}\DIFadd{'' or
``}\textit{\DIFadd{This morning }[\DIFadd{/afternoon}]\DIFadd{:}}\DIFadd{'' and measured autonomy
(``}\textit{\DIFadd{I was myself.}}\DIFadd{''), competence
(``}\textit{\DIFadd{I felt competent.}}\DIFadd{'')}\DIFaddend , \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{competence, }\DIFdelend and relatedness \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fulfillment during the interaction (cf. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(without intergroup
contact ``}\textit{\DIFadd{I had a strong need to belong}}\DIFadd{''; with intergroup
contact: ``}\textit{\DIFadd{I shared information about myself.}}\DIFadd{'' and
``}\textit{\DIFadd{The other(s) shared information about themselves.}}\DIFadd{''). All
items were rated on a continuous slider scale from very little (-50) to
a great deal (+50).
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Interaction Intent}}

\DIFadd{To assess whether an interaction was accidental (vs.~planned), we asked
participants with a single item to report the extent to which ``The
interaction with -X- was accidental''. The respondents were asked to
report this context variable for all interactions they reported on using
a continuous slider ranging from ``not at all'' (0), through ``very
little'' (33) and ``somewhat'' (66), to ``a great deal'' (100). In all
studies, the scale showed a right skew (}\textit{\DIFadd{mean}} \DIFadd{= 29.60}\DIFaddend ,

\DIFadd{To assess whether the need content (i.e., the motives) would impact the
effect of the need fulfillment experiences, we manually coded the topics
we extracted during the topic modeling on two dimensions of how much
they reflect a practical and a psychological goal-directedness. We chose
practical and psychological needs specifically as our dimensions to
account for differences in the types of needs that participants commonly
reported. With practical motives, we refer to specific, tangible goals or
tasks that participants aimed to accomplish during the interaction.
These instrumental goals are usually observable, concrete, and often
centered on external outcomes, such as acquiring resources, completing
tasks, and addressing immediate challenges }\citep[][]{}\DIFadd{. With
psychological motives, we refer to underlying motives or desires that are
more abstract and relate to personal fulfillment and well-being. In
contrast to practical needs, psychological needs delve into the
subjective and internal aspects of human experiences. These needs
pertain to emotions, social connections, and cognitive processes,
reflecting individuals' quest for personal growth, well-being, and
thriving in social relationships }\citep[][]{}\DIFadd{. Note that with this
approach any particular motive can include a practical and/or a
psychological goal-directedness but can also be classified as not having
any goal at all. The full coding protocol we developed with examples for
each of the codes is available in our Online Supplemental Material D.
After an initial training, each of the two coders independently coded
the 47 topics on the two dimensions, using one of three options each
(i.e., 0 = no goal, 1 = vague goal, 2 = clear goal). Inter-rater
reliability assessments showed that for both the practical as well as
the psychological needs, agreement was not optimal using the three
answer options (agreement practical = 0.72\%, agreement psychological =
0.78\%). However, most disagreements were, if a need was present,
whether that need was vague (1) or concrete (2). We, thus, collapsed
these two categories, making the ratings binary (need absent vs.~need
present). With the simpler coding, inter-rater agreement for practical
needs (0.93\%) and the psychological need (0.96\%) were much more
reliable. Using Cohen's \(\kappa\) as our measure of inter-rater
reliability, we find that both the practical need coding
(}\textit{\DIFadd{Cohen's}} \DIFadd{\(\kappa\) = 0.80, 95\%CI}{[}\DIFadd{0.58, 1.00}{]}\DIFadd{) as well as
the psychological need coding (}\textit{\DIFadd{Cohen's}} \DIFadd{\(\kappa\) = 0.86,
95\%CI}{[}\DIFadd{0.67, 1.00}{]}\DIFadd{) were very good. We thus proceeded with this
collapsed coding. After resolving coder disagreements and merging the
codings back to the free-text responses, we found that a majority of
responses showed both a practical as well as a psychological need
(57.95\%) and only few responses had no goal at all (1.03\%) with the
remaining 41.02\% having either a practical or a psychological need only
(see Online Supplemental Material A for more detailed tables and
visualizations).

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Well-being}}

\DIFadd{We measured experienced well-being using a visual analog scale adapted
from }\citet{davies2022}\DIFadd{. Participants were asked to respond to the
question ``How do you feel right now?'' using a continuous visual slider
ranging from ``very sad''(-100) to ``very happy'' (100). The well-being
ratings were generally normally distributed (}\textit{\DIFadd{mean}} \DIFadd{= 64.80,
}\textit{\DIFadd{sd}} \DIFadd{= 19.25).
}

\subsection{\DIFadd{Results}}

\DIFadd{To build further confidence in our results, we assessed a number of
additional models that might offer alternative explanations. We will
discuss the results in sequential order --- in every case first
considering a global test of the model across the three studies and
only then assessing whether the global three-level regression model
suppresses any important person-level variations within the studies.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Contact specific}}

\DIFadd{We begin our robustness analysis by testing whether the effect of core
need fulfillment is specific to an actual outgroup contact, rather than
need fulfillment in general. For this, we analyzed the generalized
}\DIFaddend situational core need fulfillment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{should predict outgroup attitudes at least }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(either during a contact or about the
daytime in general) and tested whether the effect differed during
experience sampling measurements with and without outgroup contacts. We
start this test by assessing the effect across all three studies, using
a three-level hierarchical model, where measurements are nested within
participants, and participants are nested within studies. In this
overall model, we found no main effect of core need fulfillment (random
slopes model, grand-mean standardized to account for all levels of
variance; }\textit{\DIFadd{b}} \DIFadd{= 0.62, }\textit{t}( 3.187) \DIFadd{= 2.89, }\textit{\DIFadd{p}} \DIFadd{=
0.058, }\textit{95\%CI}{[} \DIFadd{0.20, 1.03}{]}\DIFadd{) but a significant interaction
effect of core need fulfillment and outgroup contact (}\textit{\DIFadd{b}} \DIFadd{= 2.44,
}\textit{t}(4,663.172) \DIFadd{= 8.62, }\textit{\DIFadd{p}} \DIFadd{\textless{} .001,
}\textit{95\%CI}{[} \DIFadd{1.89, 3.00}{]}\DIFadd{; also see
}\tblref{tab:robustnessTblLong}\DIFadd{). While the three-level hierarchical
model can be sensitive to scaling issues, this already indicates that it
is not key need fulfillment in general --- but only key need fulfillment
during an outgroup contact that predicts more positive outgroup
attitudes.
}

\DIFadd{To ensure that the results are not affected by scaling issues (e.g.,
study-level variances suppressing person-level variances) or a similar
Simpson's paradox, we additionally assess the model within each of the
three studies. Within each of the three studies, the effects are more
pronounced, so that we also see a significant effect of core need
fulfillment (all }\textit{\DIFadd{b}} \DIFadd{\textgreater{} 0.06, all }\textit{\DIFadd{p}}
\DIFadd{\textless{} 0.005) }\DIFaddend as well as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Allport's conditions. }%DIFDELCMD < \end{hyp}

\DIFadd{\textless{} 0.002, also see }\tblref{tab:robustnessTblLong}\DIFadd{). There is
thus consistent evidence that need fulfillment relates to outgroup
attitudes for outgroup contacts in particular but not need fulfillment
in general.

\DIFdel{The need model (H\ref{hyp:keyNeedPred}) should predict more }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{Interaction intent}}

\DIFadd{Secondly, to assess whether the need fulfillment mechanism affected by
whether the interaction was accidental or planned we ran an exploratory
moderation analysis using the participants' ratings of how much they
perceived the interaction as `accidental'. It should be noted that we
asked our participants to focus on most the important interaction (i.e.,
``}\textit{\DIFadd{The following questions will be about the interaction }\underline{\DIFadd{you consider most significant}}\DIFadd{.}}\DIFadd{'''\,'\,``;
emphasis as in original). We again start our analysis approach by
assessing the model across all three studies, using a three-level
hierarchical model. In this overall model, we retain the main effect of
core need fulfillment (random slopes model, grand-mean standardized to
account for all levels of variance; }\textit{\DIFadd{b}} \DIFadd{= 2.87, }\textit{t}(
7.979) \DIFadd{= 7.32, }\textit{\DIFadd{p}} \DIFadd{\textless{} .001, }\textit{95\%CI}{[} \DIFadd{2.10,
3.64}{]}\DIFadd{) but neither contact intent nor the moderation effect affect the
results (all \textbar{}}\textit{\DIFadd{b}}\DIFadd{\textbar{} \textless{} 0.27 and all
}\textit{\DIFadd{p}} \DIFadd{\textgreater{} 0.225; see }\tblref{tab:robustnessTblLong} \DIFadd{for
full results).
}

\DIFadd{We again sought to ensure that the results were not affected by scaling
issues by additionally assessing the interaction intentionality model
within each of the three studies. Within each of the three studies, the
effect of core need fulfillment became even clearer (all
\textbar{}}\textit{\DIFadd{b}}\DIFadd{\textbar{} \textgreater{} 0.13, all }\textit{\DIFadd{p}}
\DIFadd{\textless{} 0.006). But in none of the studies neither outgroup contact
intention nor the moderation effect explained a significant amount of
}\DIFaddend variance in outgroup attitudes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{than the
model based on Allport's conditions (H\ref{hyp:AllportsPred}). }%DIFDELCMD < \end{subhyp}

\textless{} 0.03 and all }\textit{\DIFadd{p}} \DIFadd{\textgreater{} 0.073; also see
}\tblref{tab:robustnessTblLong}\DIFadd{). There is thus consistent evidence that
need fulfillment is related to outgroup attitudes, even when taking the
intentionality of the interaction into account --- at least in our three
samples and with a focus on the most significant interactions.

\DIFdel{The  effect of
key need fulfillment on outgroup attitudes should  persist }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{Well-being outcome}}

\DIFadd{Thirdly, to build a stronger case for the relevance of need fulfillment
to minority group members, we exploratorily assessed the effect of need
fulfilling outgroup interactions on self-reported well-being. We, thus,
re-ran our main analysis but substituted the outgroup attitudes outcome
with situational well-being. As with the previous robustness analyses,
we begin with a global three-level hierarchical model (across the three
studies). We find that need fulfillment during outgroup contacts,
indeed, has a similar effect on experienced well-being (random slopes
model, grand-mean standardized to account for all levels of variance;
}\textit{\DIFadd{b}} \DIFadd{= 3.50, }\textit{t}(4.219) \DIFadd{= 6.33, }\textit{\DIFadd{p}} \DIFadd{= 0.003,
}\textit{95\%CI}{[} \DIFadd{2.42, 4.58}{]}\DIFadd{). We found the same result when we
assessed each of the three studies individually. In each of the studies,
situational need fulfillment during the outgroup interaction was related
to higher well-being ratings by the participants (random slopes model,
centered within participants; all \textbar{}}\textit{\DIFadd{b}}\DIFadd{\textbar{}
\textgreater{} 0.10, all }\textit{\DIFadd{p}} \DIFadd{\textless{} 0.009). We, thus, find
consistent and meaningful evidence that need fulfilling outgroup
interactions also relate to higher everyday well-being.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Need types}}

\paragraph{\DIFadd{overall}}

\DIFadd{Fourthly, to assess the role of different types of motives reported by
our participants, we added our coding of practical and psychological
goal-directedness as additional predictors to our base model. We thus
had core need fulfillment predicting outgroup attitudes while also
accounting for whether the reported motives were capturing practical
and/or psychological motives. We again ran a global model, across the
three studies first. We found that core need fulfillment remains a core
predictor of outgroup attitudes (random slopes model, grand-mean
standardized to account for all levels of variance; }\textit{\DIFadd{b}} \DIFadd{= 2.27,
}\textit{t}( 48.194) \DIFadd{= 2.72, }\textit{\DIFadd{p}} \DIFadd{= 0.009, }\textit{95\%CI}{[} \DIFadd{0.63,
3.90}{]}\DIFadd{), even after accounting for different types of motives. None of
the motive types nor the moderation effects reached statistical
significance within the overall analysis (all
\textbar{}}\textit{\DIFadd{b}}\DIFadd{\textbar{} \textless{} 1.45 and all }\textit{\DIFadd{p}}
\DIFadd{\textgreater{} 0.073; see }\tblref{tab:robustnessTblLong} \DIFadd{for full
results).
}

\paragraph{\DIFadd{Study follow-up}}

\DIFadd{When looking at the individual studies, we again saw that the effect of
core need fulfillment remained the on only clear effect (all
\textbar{}}\textit{\DIFadd{b}}\DIFadd{\textbar{} \textgreater{} 0.14, all }\textit{\DIFadd{p}}
\DIFadd{\textless{} 0.015). Additionally, in none of the studies neither motive
type dummies nor the moderation effect explained a significant amount of
variance in outgroup attitudes (all \textbar{}}\textit{\DIFadd{b}}\DIFadd{\textbar{}
\textless{} 1.53 and all }\textit{\DIFadd{p}} \DIFadd{\textgreater{} 0.144; also see
}\tblref{tab:robustnessTblLong}\DIFadd{). We, thus, find consistent evidence that
need fulfillment is related to outgroup attitudes, }\DIFaddend even when taking \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{other Allport's conditions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the
type of need into account --- at least in our three samples.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Specific psychological needs}}

\DIFadd{In a final step, we checked whether during the interaction the core
situational need remains a meaningful predictor even when taking other
fundamental psychological needs }\DIFaddend into account. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Thus, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We again take a two-step
approach, starting with cross-study global three-level test and then
assessing the effects within the individual studies. Within the overall
model, we find that across the studies core need fulfillment remained a
strong predictor of outgroup attitudes, even after controlling for the
three self-determination theory need (random slopes model, grand-mean
standardized to account for all levels of variance; }\textit{\DIFadd{b}} \DIFadd{= 1.88,
}\textit{t}(2.705) \DIFadd{= 4.75, }\textit{\DIFadd{p}} \DIFadd{= 0.022, }\textit{95\%CI}{[} \DIFadd{1.11,
2.66}{]}\DIFadd{). Within this overall analysis, none of the self-determination
theory needs independently predicted outgroup attitudes to a
statistically significant extent (all }\textit{\DIFadd{p}} \DIFadd{\textgreater{} 0.095).
However, some of the effect sizes were largely comparable to that of the
core need fulfillment (all \textbar{}}\textit{\DIFadd{b}}\DIFadd{\textbar{} \textless{}
2.10, particularly that of relatedness fulfillment; see
}\tblref{tab:robustnessTblLong} \DIFadd{for full results).
}

\DIFadd{When looking at the individual studies, we again saw that core need
fulfillment remained a consistent predictor of outgroup attitudes, even
after accounting for }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{effect of key need fulfillment on outgroup attitudesshould remain strong even
after controlling for equal status, common goals, collaboration, and structural support. }%DIFDELCMD < \end{subhyp}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{self-determination theory need (all
\textbar{}}\textit{\DIFadd{b}}\DIFadd{\textbar{} \textgreater{} 0.06, all }\textit{\DIFadd{p}}
\DIFadd{\textless{} 0.033). However, across all three studies, the fulfillment of
relatedness motives also emerged as a consistent predictor of outgroup
attitudes (all \textbar{}}\textit{\DIFadd{b}}\DIFadd{\textbar{} \textgreater{} 0.06, all
}\textit{\DIFadd{p}} \DIFadd{\textless{} 0.001). Additionally, in the larger studies 2 and
3 competence fulfillment was also related to more positive outgroup
attitudes (study 2: }\textit{\DIFadd{b}} \DIFadd{= 0.05, }\textit{t}(841.8) \DIFadd{= 2.43,
}\textit{\DIFadd{p}} \DIFadd{= 0.015, }\textit{95\%CI}{[} \DIFadd{0.01, 0.10}{]}\DIFadd{, study 3:
}\textit{\DIFadd{b}} \DIFadd{= 0.06, }\textit{t}(30.20) \DIFadd{= 2.62, }\textit{\DIFadd{p}} \DIFadd{= 0.013,
}\textit{95\%CI}{[} \DIFadd{0.01, 0.10}{]}\DIFadd{). None of the autonomy fulfillment
effects reached statistical significance nor did the competence
fulfillment during study 1 (see }\tblref{tab:robustnessTblLong} \DIFadd{for the
full results). In short, find that across our samples, relatedness
fulfillment (and to a smaller extent competence fulfillment) are
instrumental in understanding when an outgroup contact leads to more
positive outgroup attitudes. Importantly, even when considering these
effects situational core need fulfillment remains a strong and
consistent predictor of outgroup attitudes. In some cases, we even find
that core need fulfillment takes on some of the variance that would
otherwise be explained by the self-determination theory needs (see
Online Supplemental Material A).
}

\subsection{\DIFadd{Conclusion}}
\DIFadd{Across the wide variety of robustness analyses, we thus find that the experience of psychological need fulfillment is a robust and flexible predictor of positive outgroup attitudes even when accounting for a range of other and even alternate predictors. However, we also find that the core need fulfillment mechanism does not account for all need-related variance in outgroup attitudes. Notably, the fulfillment of relatedness (and to some extent competence) needs explained additional variance in outgroup attitudes. Nonetheless, the situational core need fulfillment remained extremely reliably a core predictor of outgroup attitudes.
