Conflict between social groups and their individual members remains a prevalent feature of the modern human condition. Prejudices, discrimination, and animosities continue to plague societies around the world. One of the main ameliorations proposed by social psychologists has been positive intergroup contact. Based on Allport's (\citeyear{Allport1954b}) contact hypothesis, a plethora of studies and interventions have worked on bringing different social groups together \citep[e.g.,][]{AlRamiah2012a, Reimer2021}. 
% Yet, despite ...

In its most essential interpretation, the intergroup contact hypothesis postulates that frequent and positive contact with an out-group reduces prejudice and increases favorable attitudes towards the other group \citep[e.g.,][]{Hewstone1996, Pettigrew1998}. A key condition for these contact benefits, has been that the interaction is indeed perceived as positive --- making the interaction quality a crucial mechanism of inter-group contact \citep[e.g.,][]{MacInnis2015}. It is widely accepted that equal status, common goals, collaboration, and structural support during the interaction form the optimal conditions for a positive contact \citep[Allport's Optimal Contact conditions,][]{Allport1954b, Pettigrew1969}. And indeed a major meta-analytic review showed, that intergroup contact benefits were larger when Allport's conditions were met. However, the meta-analysis also showed that contact resulted in more positive intergroup relations even when Allport's conditions were not met \citep[][]{Pettigrew2006}. It, thus, remains unclear when and why exactly an interaction is perceived as positive and what factors (beyond Allport's conditions) explain positive contact effects.

In this article, we propose that the fulfillment of fundamental psychological needs might offer a psycho-social mechanism for understanding and explaining contact quality and in extension positive outgroup attitudes. That is to say, that if someone seeks/wishes to ... . 
Additionally, such needs might even explain the effectiveness of Allport's optimal contact conditions, if these conditions constitute common psychological needs of the interacting individual. To test this we collected three sets of real-life data from recent immigrants, tracking situational needs, interaction quality, and outgroup attitudes, following their daily interactions with host majority group members. 

\section{Intergroup Contact Mechanisms}
\faQuestionCircle\ \textit{Not sure whether we need this section.}

\faExclamationCircle\ \textit{This section has become way too complex (i.e., too many arguments to get to our own proposed work). I think we ultimately need to introduce the concept of interaction quality and that we don't necessarily know why interactions are perceived as positive, therefore we propose that we can look towards the motivational literature for this. The difficulties started for me when I tried to give credit to past theoretical work (which I thought we need to acknowledge in some way).}

As one of the most researched and practically implemented theories of social psychology, intergroup contact has received a vast amount of empirical, and theoretical attention \citep[][]{Dovidio2017}. Several meta-analytic reviews have found moderately sized positive effects of intergroup contact \citep[][]{Tropp2005, Pettigrew2006, Davies2011} and later meta-analyses have additionally shown that intergroup contact is also effective outside the lab \citep[][]{Beelmann2014, Lemmer2015}, during online contact \citep[][]{White2020}, as well as during several more indirect forms of contact \citep[][]{Miles2014, Zhou2019, Harwood2021}. With such a persistent and meaningful effect, researchers have long proposed theoretical models to understand these intergroup contact effects. 

Interestingly, one concept that has arguably remained at the center of theoretical debates throughout the decades has been the role of 'positive' contact. In his now famous chapter on 'the effects of contact', Gordon Allport (\citeyear{Allport1954b}) set out to summarize under what circumstances an interaction between groups tends to be positive, leading to favourable attitudes and reduced prejudice. In the years that followed, several additional conditions were proposed under which a positive intergroup contact would occur \citep[for a critical review see][]{Pettigrew1986}. As a counter-movement to this rather restrictive approach, with the beginning of the 21\textsuperscript{st} century attention had shifted towards investigating the psychological mechanisms of intergroup contact \citep[e.g. see,][]{Paolini2021}. With this shift in focus, the idea of 'positive contact' has seemingly seen a renaissance, where the adjective 'positive' is now not merely an evaluation of the outcome, but rather a feature of the interaction itself. As such, recent work has focused on the role of 'perceived interaction quality' \citep[e.g.,][]{Brown2007, Voci2003} or 'interaction valence' \citep[e.g.,][]{Tropp2016, Barlow2012}, to show that only if an interaction is perceived as positive will it lead to more favourable intergroup relations. And inversely interactions that are perceived as negative have the strong propensity to harm outgroup attitudes. However, relatively little research has investigated why interactions are perceived as positive.

Thus although a sizeable number of moderators and mediators of intergroup contact have been proposed, their effects might be undermined if they do not result in a 'positive' contact. As an example, important moderators and mediators that have been identified are different forms of social categorizations \citep[][]{Pettigrew1998}, the salience of social categories \citep[][]{Brown2005}, intimacy \citep[e.g.,][]{Marinucci2021} and attachment \citep[e.g.,][]{Tropp2021}, threat and intergroup anxiety \citep[e.g.,][]{Stephan2008, Paolini2004}, and to a lesser extent knowledge about the other group \citep[][]{Pettigrew2008c}. However, there is a discernible disconnect between these mechanisms and perceptions that an interaction is positive. That is to say that, just because someone learns something new about the other group, or reduces their threat perceptions does not mean that such an interaction is perceived as positive. Or inversely, an interaction can, for example, be very intimate but perceived as negative. If that were the case, there is a reasonable chance that such an interaction might not translate into improved outgroup attitudes \citep[e.g.,][]{Barlow2012}. We propose that we may look to the literature on motivation and psychological needs to understand when and why exactly an interaction is perceived as positive.


ALTERNATIVE: One potential remedy might come from looking to the literature on motivation and psychological needs to understand when and why exactly an interaction is perceived as positive. 

\section{Psychological Needs in Intergroup Relations}
Although considerations of psychological needs and motivations have remained markedly absent within the intergroup contact literature, the concepts are in no way foreign to the general topic of intergroup relations. On the most general level, research on intergroup conflicts has, for example, shown that addressing the group-specific needs predicts willingness to reconcile with the other group \citep[][]{Shnabel2008}. For the case of refugee migrants in their relationship with a majority group, a recent study found that identity needs will buffer against discrimination experiences and will protect personal health \citep[][]{Celebi2017}. Additionally, within the field of interpersonal relations, we find first evidence that the fulfillment of fundamental psychological needs might predict perceived interaction quality in non-intergroup interactions \citep[][]{Downie2008}. 

And even within the field of intergroup contact the idea of need fulfillment as a psychological mechanism is not entirely novel. \citet{Dovidio2017} in their narrative review have suggested that understanding psychological needs might be essential to constructive intergroup contact. And recently first empirical research has even found psychological need fulfillment during intergroup contacts to predict support for social change  \citep[][]{Hassler2021}. There is thus initial evidence to suggest that need fulfillment during intergroup contact might offer a promising psychological mechanism to understand perceived interaction quality and positive outgroup attitudes. 

One reason why motivational considerations might have remained absent from the intergroup contact literature is that people might enter into a contact with a plethora of individual needs or goals that might be relevant to them in that particular situation. Researchers considering the motivational content would, thus, either test few hyper-specific needs that might not be transferable to other intergroup contexts or they may need to assess a broad range of fundamental psychological needs. To avoid this predicament we propose to start by using adaptive and responsive survey designs that allow a tailored approach based on the participants inputs \citep[e.g.,][]{Tourangeau2017}. In particular, we propose to ask the participants to report their main goal during the interaction in a short open-ended question (i.e., situation core need) and with reference to their own response the participants can then indicate how much this need was fulfilled during the interaction (i.e., need fulfillment). Such an adaptive approach allows us to test the fundamental psychological mechanism of whether situational psychological needs indeed predict perceived interaction quality and positive outgroup attitudes. 

\section{Real-Life Process Data}
Over the past two decades several reviewers of the field have advocated that to truly understand intergroup contacts, there is a need for studies that collect longitudinal \citep[][]{Pettigrew1998, Pettigrew2008, Pettigrew2008b, Pettigrew2011} and real-life data outside the lab \citep[][]{MacInnis2015, McKeown2017}. The reasoning behind these calls for longitudinal real-life data has been manifold. Among the most pressing issues is concern that past investigations of intergroup contact have either focused on the dynamics of individual interactions but within artificial laboratory settings or have collected data situated within the lived experiences but used retrospective self-report data that asked about past interactions in general. The collection of data over time would, thus, allow researchers to follow the development of intergroup relations as they develop across multiple interactions. At the same time, such longitudinal data would also be situated within the real-life experiences of the participant. Additionally, such experience-sampling data can be close to the intergroup interactions would largely mitigate recall biases. Moreover, intensive longitudinal data often allows to capture large amounts of high-quality data with relatively few participants.

In the past such data collections were often unfeasible because they were either physically impractical or too expensive. However, recent technological developments allow us to easily collect experience sampling data on mobile devices \citep[e.g.,][]{Keil2020} or using web-based applications \citep[e.g.,][]{Arslan2020}. At the same time, analytical methods for such more complex data have become more readily available, making the analyses more approachable \citep[see, e.g.,][]{ODonnell2021}. Given these, technological and methodological developments, we were able to collect a large amount of real-life data following the daily intergroup interactions of recent migrants with the majority group members.  

\section{The Present Research}


\begin{itemize}
    \item aims
    \item shortened hypotheses
    \item analysis strategy
    \item assumptions, materials, preregistration
\end{itemize}


Based on this we formulated four main hypotheses:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Based on the most general understanding of the contact hypothesis, an increase in frequency and quality of contact should jointly account for changes in more favorable outgroup attitudes.
    \item Based on Allport’s optimal contact conditions, intergroup interactions with equal status, common goals, collaboration, and structural support should predict more favorable outgroup attitudes due to more positive interaction quality perceptions.
    \item Based on our proposal, intergroup interactions with higher situational core need fulfillment should predict more favorable outgroup attitudes due to more positive interaction quality perceptions.
    \item Based on our proposal, intergroup interactions with higher situational core need fulfillment should predict outgroup attitudes at least as well as Allport’s conditions.
\end{enumerate}
