Conflict between social groups and their individual members remains a prevalent feature of the modern human condition. Prejudices, discrimination, and animosities continue to plague societies around the world. One of the main ameliorations proposed by social psychologists has been positive intergroup contact. Based on Allport's (\citeyear{Allport1954b}) contact hypothesis, a plethora of studies and interventions have worked on bringing different social groups together \citep[e.g.,][]{AlRamiah2012a, Reimer2021}. 
% Yet, despite ...

In its most essential interpretation, the intergroup contact hypothesis postulates that frequent and positive contact with an out-group reduces prejudice and increases favorable attitudes towards the other group \citep[e.g.,][]{Hewstone1996, Pettigrew1998}. A key condition for these contact benefits, has been that the interaction is indeed perceived as positive --- making the interaction quality a crucial mechanism of inter-group contact \citep[e.g.,][]{MacInnis2015}. It is widely accepted that equal status, common goals, collaboration, and structural support during the interaction form the optimal conditions for a positive contact \citep[Allport's Optimal Contact conditions,][]{Allport1954b, Pettigrew1969}. And indeed a major meta-analytic review showed, that intergroup contact benefits were larger when Allport's conditions were met. However, the meta-analysis also showed that contact resulted in more positive intergroup relations even when Allport's conditions were not met \citep[][]{Pettigrew2006}. It, thus, remains unclear when and why exactly an interaction is perceived as positive and what factors (beyond Allport's conditions) explain positive contact effects.

In this article, we propose that the fulfillment of fundamental psychological needs might offer a psycho-social mechanism for understanding and explaining contact quality and in extension positive outgroup attitudes. That is to say, that if someone seeks/wishes to ... . 
Additionally, such needs might even explain the effectiveness of Allport's optimal contact conditions, if these conditions constitute common psychological needs of the interacting individuals. To test this we collected three sets of real-life data from recent immigrants, tracking situational needs, interaction quality, and outgroup attitudes, following their daily interactions with host majority group members. 

\section{Intergroup Contact Mechanisms}
\faQuestionCircle\ Not sure whether we need this section

As one of the most researched and practically implemented theories of social psychology, intergroup contact has received a vast amount of empirical, and theoretical attention \citep[][]{Dovidio2017}. Several meta-analytic reviews have found moderately sized positive effects of intergroup contact \citep[][]{Tropp2005, Pettigrew2006, Davies2011}. Additional meta-analyses have additionally shown that intergroup contact is also effective outside the lab \citep[][]{Beelmann2014, Lemmer2015}, during online contact \citep[][]{White2020}, as well as during several more indirect forms of contact \citep[][]{Miles2014, Zhou2019, Harwood2021}. 

With such a persistent and meaningful effect, researchers have long proposed theoretical models to understand these intergroup contact effects. These searches for moderators and mediators have, for example, highlighted different forms of social categorizations \citep[][]{Pettigrew1998}, the salience of social categories \citep[][]{Brown2005}, intimacy \citep[e.g.,][]{Marinucci2021} and attachment \citep[e.g.,][]{Tropp2021}, threat and intergroup anxiety \citep[e.g.,][]{Stephan2008, Paolini2004}, and to a lesser extent knowledge about the other group \citep[][]{Pettigrew2008c}.

Interestingly, one concept that has arguably remained at the center of theoretical debates throughout the decades has been the role of 'positive' contact. \st{Although Gordon Allport was not generally optimistic of intergroup contact (especially if it was casual or by too deeply prejudiced individuals), he did see immense potential if only such interactions led to positive associations.} In his now famous chapter on 'the effects of contact', Gordon Allport (\citeyear{Allport1954b}) set out to summarize under what circumstances an interaction between groups tends to be positive, leading to favourable attitudes and reduced prejudice. In the years that followed, several additional conditions were proposed under which a positive intergroup contact would occur \citep[for a critical review see][]{Pettigrew1986}. As a counter-movement to this rather restrictive approach, with the beginning of the 21\textsuperscript{st} century attention had shifted towards investigating the psychological mechanisms of intergroup contact \citep[e.g. see,][]{Paolini2021}. With this shift in focus, the idea of 'positive contact' has seemingly seen a renaissance, where the adjective positive is now not merely an evaluation of the outcome, but rather a feature of the interaction itself. As such, recent work has focused on the role of 'perceived interaction quality' \citep[e.g.,][]{Brown2007, Voci2003} or 'interaction valence' \citep[e.g.,][]{Tropp2016, Barlow2012}, to show that whether a  

MAYBE: Yet, relatively little research has investigated why interactions are perceived as positive. That is to say that although a sizeable number of moderators and mediators of intergroup contact have been proposed and interaction quality is seen as an important to the betterment of intergroup relations, 

ALTERNATIVE: The literature on intergroup contacts, has thus far mostly ignored the role of individual and social motivations within the intergroup contact process.

    Psychological needs might “explain the asymmetry of experiences and outcomes in intergroup interactions and identify an essential element for interventions: To achieve truly constructive intergroup relations, it is important that intergroup exchanges meet the psychological needs of both majority- and minority-group members” \\

\section{Process Data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item retrospective vs. near-time data
    \item need for longitudinal \citep[][]{Pettigrew1998, Pettigrew2008, Pettigrew2008b, Pettigrew2011} and real-life data \citep[][]{MacInnis2015, McKeown2017}
    \item barriers
    \item innovations like 'contact logger' \citep[][]{Keil2020}, and FormR \citep[][]{Arslan2020} make this possible now \citep[also see, e.g.,][]{ODonnell2021}
\end{itemize}

\faQuestionCircle\ Not sure where this goes: To ensure that our sample would have a considerable number of intergroup contacts we focused on the minority group perspective in our second study. We followed a group of young migrants who had (daily) intergroup contacts with majority Dutch people. This design allowed us to test whether intergroup interactions and the fulfillment of psychological needs could jointly predict the development of attitudes towards the outgroup (i.e., the Dutch host society).

\section{Appendix A: Hypotheses}
\label{app:AppendixA}

\begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:contact}] \label{hyp:contact}
Based on the most general understanding of the contact hypothesis, an increase in frequency and quality of contact should jointly account for changes in more favorable outgroup attitudes.
\end{hyp}

\begin{subhyp}[H\ref{hyp:contactFreq}] \label{hyp:contactFreq}
\addtolength{\leftskip}{2.5em}
Participants with more intergroup interactions should have a more favorable outgroup attitudes.
\end{subhyp}

\begin{subhyp}[H\ref{hyp:contactDummy}] \label{hyp:contactDummy}
\addtolength{\leftskip}{2.5em}
Outgroup attitudes should be more positive after an intergroup interaction compared to a non-outgroup interaction.
\end{subhyp}

\begin{subhyp}[H\ref{hyp:contactFreqQual}] \label{hyp:contactFreqQual}
\addtolength{\leftskip}{2.5em}
Participants with more intergroup interactions should have a more favorable outgroup attitudes depending on the average interaction quality.
\end{subhyp}

\begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:AllportsConditions}] \label{hyp:AllportsConditions}
Based on Allport's optimal contact conditions, intergroup interactions with equal status, common goals, collaboration, and structural support should predict more favorable outgroup attitudes due to more positive interaction quality perceptions.
\end{hyp}

\setcounter{subhyp}{0}
\begin{subhyp}[H\ref{hyp:AllportsPred}] \label{hyp:AllportsPred}
\addtolength{\leftskip}{2.5em}
Based on Allport's optimal contact conditions, outgroup attitudes should be more favorable after intergroup interactions with equal status, common goals, collaboration, and structural support.
\end{subhyp}

\begin{subhyp}[H\ref{hyp:AllportsQuality}] \label{hyp:AllportsQuality}
\addtolength{\leftskip}{2.5em}
Based on past research on the role of interaction quality, interaction quality should be more perceived as more favorable after intergroup interactions with equal status, common goals, collaboration, and structural support.
\end{subhyp}

\begin{subhyp}[H\ref{hyp:AllportsQualityMediation}] \label{hyp:AllportsQualityMediation}
\addtolength{\leftskip}{2.5em}
Based on past research on the role of interaction quality, the variance explained in outgroup attitudes by Allport's optimal contact should to a large extend be assumed by interaction quality.
\end{subhyp}

\begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:keyNeed}] \label{hyp:keyNeed}
Based on our proposal, intergroup interactions with higher situational core need fulfillment should predict more favorable outgroup attitudes due to more positive interaction quality perceptions.
\end{hyp}

\setcounter{subhyp}{0}
\begin{subhyp}[H\ref{hyp:keyNeedPred}] \label{hyp:keyNeedPred}
\addtolength{\leftskip}{2.5em}
Outgroup attitudes should be more favorable after intergroup interactions with high key need fulfillment.
\end{subhyp}

\begin{subhyp}[H\ref{hyp:keyNeedQual}] \label{hyp:keyNeedQual}
\addtolength{\leftskip}{2.5em}
Interaction Quality should be perceived as more positive after intergroup interactions with higher key need fulfillment.
\end{subhyp}

\begin{subhyp}[H\ref{hyp:keyNeedMediation}] \label{hyp:keyNeedMediation}
\addtolength{\leftskip}{2.5em}
The variance explained in outgroup attitudes by key need fulfillment should to a large extend be assumed by interaction quality.
\end{subhyp}

\begin{subhyp}[H\ref{hyp:keyNeedContactType}] \label{hyp:keyNeedContactType}
\addtolength{\leftskip}{2.5em}
The effect of key need fulfillment on outgroup attitudes should be specific to intergroup interactions and not be due to need fulfillment in general. Thus, the effect of key need fulfillment on outgroup attitudes should stronger for intergroup interact than for ingroup interactions. 
\end{subhyp}

\begin{subhyp}[H\ref{hyp:keyNeedSDT}] \label{hyp:keyNeedSDT}
\addtolength{\leftskip}{2.5em}
The effect of key need fulfillment on outgroup attitudes should be persist even when taking other fundamental psychological needs into account. Thus, the effect of key need fulfillment on outgroup attitudes should remain strong even after controlling for autonomy, competence, and relatedness fulfillment during the interaction (cf., self-determination theory). 
\end{subhyp}

\begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:comparison}] \label{hyp:comparison}
Based on our proposal, intergroup interactions with higher situational core need fulfillment should predict outgroup attitudes at least as well as Allport's conditions.
\end{hyp}

\setcounter{subhyp}{0}
\begin{subhyp}[H\ref{hyp:compModel}] \label{hyp:compModel}
\addtolength{\leftskip}{2.5em}
The need model (H\ref{hyp:keyNeedPred}) should predict more variance in outgroup attitudes than the model based on Allport's conditions (H\ref{hyp:AllportsPred}).
\end{subhyp}

\begin{subhyp}[H\ref{hyp:compTogether}] \label{hyp:compTogether}
\addtolength{\leftskip}{2.5em}
The  effect of key need fulfillment on outgroup attitudes should  persist even when taking other Allport's conditions into account. Thus, the effect of key need fulfillment on outgroup attitudes should remain strong even after controlling for equal status, common goals, collaboration, and structural support.  
\end{subhyp}
